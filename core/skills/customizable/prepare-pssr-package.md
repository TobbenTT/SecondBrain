# Prepare PSSR Package
## Skill ID: DOC-04
## Version: 1.0.0
## Category: B. Document Management
## Priority: P0 - Safety Critical
## Agent: Agent 2 - Documentation & Knowledge Management

## Purpose

Prepare comprehensive Pre-Startup Safety Review (PSSR) packages that verify all safety, operational, maintenance, and regulatory requirements are satisfied before introducing hazardous materials or energy into a new or modified process system. This skill automates the assembly, verification, and tracking of PSSR documentation while maintaining the rigor required for process safety compliance.

The PSSR is the final safety gate before a process system becomes operational. It is the last opportunity to catch deficiencies in design, construction, documentation, training, and emergency preparedness before hydrocarbons, chemicals, or other hazardous materials are introduced. Industry data paints a stark picture: 30-40% of startup incidents can be traced to failures in the Pre-Startup Safety Review process (Center for Chemical Process Safety - CCPS, "Guidelines for Performing Effective Pre-Startup Safety Reviews," 2007; CSB investigation findings). These failures include incomplete PSSR checklists, missing documentation items that were "waived" without proper risk assessment, and PSSRs conducted as administrative exercises rather than genuine safety reviews.

The consequences of PSSR failures are severe. The CSB investigation of the 2005 BP Texas City explosion found that inadequate startup procedures and incomplete safety reviews were contributing factors in an incident that killed 15 workers and injured 180. OSHA PSM enforcement data shows that PSSR violations consistently rank among the top 5 most-cited PSM elements, with penalties ranging from $15,000 to $156,259 per violation.

This skill directly addresses Pain Point CE-04 (Commissioning/Engineering Gap - Startup Incident Prevention) by ensuring that every PSSR package is complete, documented, verified, and traceable before startup authorization is granted.

## Intent & Specification

The AI agent MUST understand and execute the following core objectives:

1. **PSSR Checklist Generation**: Generate system-specific PSSR checklists based on the scope of work (new installation, modification, or temporary change). Checklists must cover all elements required by OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(i), including construction verification, equipment inspection, operating procedures, training, process safety information, and emergency response readiness. Checklists must be tailored to the specific equipment, hazards, and regulatory requirements of the system being reviewed.

2. **Document Package Assembly**: Automatically assemble all supporting documents required for the PSSR into a structured package. This includes approved P&IDs (as-built), operating procedures (current and approved), training records (all operators certified), punch list closure records, inspection certificates, commissioning test results, HAZOP recommendations closure status, and MOC completion verification. The agent must verify each document is present, at the correct revision, and approved.

3. **Gap Analysis & Risk Assessment**: Identify gaps in the PSSR package -- missing documents, incomplete checklist items, unresolved punch list items, outstanding HAZOP recommendations. For each gap, assess the risk: can the gap be accepted for startup with a compensating measure, or is it a "hold" that must be resolved before startup? This risk-based approach prevents both unnecessary delays (holding startup for trivial items) and unsafe startups (proceeding with critical gaps).

4. **Multi-Party Coordination**: PSSRs require input and sign-off from multiple parties: operations, maintenance, safety/HSE, engineering, commissioning, and sometimes the owner/operator, regulatory authorities, and insurance underwriters. The agent must track the status of each party's review, follow up on outstanding items, and consolidate all approvals into the final authorization package.

5. **Regulatory Compliance Verification**: Ensure the PSSR package satisfies all applicable regulatory requirements including OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(i), EPA 40 CFR 68.77, Chilean DS 132 (mining operations), and any site-specific requirements from regulatory permits or consent conditions.

6. **Historical Tracking & Lessons Learned**: Maintain a register of all PSSRs conducted, their findings, open items, and closure dates. Analyze patterns in PSSR findings to identify systemic issues (e.g., consistently missing training records, recurring punch list categories) and feed back into project execution improvement.

## Methodology & Standards

### Primary Regulatory Standards
- **OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(i)** - Pre-Startup Safety Review: Core US PSM requirement. Requires PSSR for new facilities and for modified facilities when the modification is significant enough to require a change in process safety information. Must confirm: (1) Construction/equipment per design, (2) Safety/operating/maintenance/emergency procedures in place, (3) PHA recommendations resolved, (4) Training completed, (5) Modified facilities: MOC requirements met.
- **EPA 40 CFR 68.77** - Pre-Startup Review: RMP program requirement mirroring OSHA PSM PSSR requirements.
- **API RP 750** - Management of Process Hazards: Industry recommended practice for process hazard management including pre-startup reviews.

### International Standards
- **Seveso III Directive (2012/18/EU) Article 12** - Requires major accident prevention policy including procedures for startup and normal operation
- **UK COMAH Regulations** - Control of Major Accident Hazards: Requires demonstration of safe startup capabilities
- **IEC 61511-1** - Functional Safety: Requires verification of safety instrumented systems before startup (SIF/SIL validation)

### Chilean Regulatory Standards
- **DS 132 Art. 21** - Reglamento de Seguridad Minera: Requires pre-startup safety verification for mining operations
- **DS 594** - Workplace safety conditions must be verified before operation
- **SERNAGEOMIN requirements** - Mining-specific startup authorization requirements

### Industry Standards
- **CCPS "Guidelines for Performing Effective Pre-Startup Safety Reviews"** (2007): Definitive industry guide for PSSR methodology, checklists, and best practices
- **NFPA 45, 652, 654** - Fire protection verification requirements for startup
- **ASME codes** - Pressure equipment verification before service
- **API 510, 570, 653** - Inspection requirements before operation
- **IEEE standards** - Electrical system commissioning and startup requirements

### Industry Statistics
- 30-40% of startup incidents are attributable to PSSR failures or incomplete reviews (CCPS data)
- Average time to complete a PSSR for a major system: 2-4 weeks (including documentation assembly)
- Typical PSSR checklist: 100-300 items depending on system complexity
- OSHA PSM PSSR citation frequency: #4 most-cited PSM element (behind PHA, Operating Procedures, and Mechanical Integrity)
- Average PSSR open items at first review: 15-25% of checklist items (industry benchmark)
- Cost of OSHA PSM PSSR violation: $15,000-$156,259 per citation (2024 rates)
- Ratio of PSSR preparation effort (documentation assembly) to actual review: approximately 80:20 -- most effort is in gathering and verifying documents
- Startup delay due to incomplete PSSR: average 2-4 weeks per occurrence (IPA project benchmarks)

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Scope Definition & Checklist Generation (Steps 1-3)

**Step 1: Define PSSR Scope and Boundaries**
- Confirm system boundaries:
  - Equipment list (all tags within PSSR scope)
  - P&ID references (all drawings showing the system)
  - Physical boundaries (battery limits, isolation points)
  - Functional boundaries (what the system does, interfaces with adjacent systems)
- Determine PSSR trigger type and applicable regulatory requirements:
  - New Installation: Full PSSR per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(i)(1)-(4)
  - Modification (MOC): PSSR per OSHA 29 CFR 1910.119(i)(1)-(5); includes MOC verification
  - Restart: Scope based on duration and nature of shutdown; risk-based checklist
  - Temporary Change: Focused PSSR on temporary change scope; includes reversal requirements
- Identify PSSR team:
  - Operations representative (mandatory)
  - Maintenance representative (mandatory)
  - HSE representative (mandatory)
  - Engineering representative (mandatory)
  - Commissioning lead (for new installations)
  - Process safety engineer (for HHC or HHE facilities)
  - Additional: regulatory liaison, insurance representative (if required)

**Step 2: Generate System-Specific Checklist**
- Start with master PSSR checklist template (all 15 categories)
- Tailor to specific system by:
  - Including equipment-specific items (e.g., rotating equipment checks for pumps/compressors)
  - Including process-specific items (e.g., chemical compatibility checks for reagent systems)
  - Including regulatory-specific items (e.g., environmental permit conditions for emissions sources)
  - Excluding non-applicable items (e.g., pressure vessel certification for electrical-only systems) with documented rationale
- For MOC-triggered PSSRs:
  - Add MOC-specific items (change documentation complete, affected procedures updated, affected personnel notified)
  - Focus checklist on areas of change and immediately adjacent systems
- Number all checklist items sequentially by category
- Assign required evidence documents to each checklist item
- Set responsibility for each checklist item (which PSSR team member verifies)

**Step 3: Identify Required Documents**
- Generate document requirement list based on checklist items:
  - As-built P&IDs (verified current per DOC-03)
  - Operating procedures (verified current and approved per DOC-02)
  - Emergency procedures (verified current)
  - Training records (per create-training-plan output)
  - Commissioning test records (completion certificates, test results)
  - Equipment inspection certificates (pressure vessels, lifting equipment, electrical)
  - HAZOP study and action item closure status
  - MOC documentation (if applicable)
  - Vendor O&M manuals (per DOC-01 handover status)
  - Spare parts readiness confirmation (per PROC-01)
  - Environmental permit conditions compliance evidence
  - Safety system verification records (SIF/SIL testing results)
  - Fire protection system commissioning records
  - Emergency response plan (updated for new system)
  - Punch list status report (all Category A items closed)
- Query document management system (via mcp-sharepoint) for each required document
- Flag missing documents, wrong revisions, and unapproved documents

### Phase 2: Document Assembly & Verification (Steps 4-6)

**Step 4: Assemble Document Package**
- For each required document:
  - Retrieve from SharePoint document library (via mcp-sharepoint)
  - Verify revision matches expected (as-built/current revision)
  - Verify approval status (must be formally approved, not draft)
  - Verify currency (review date within required period, verified by DOC-03)
  - Extract key data (approval date, approver, revision history)
  - Add to PSSR package with cross-reference to checklist item
- For documents that exist but have issues:
  - Wrong revision: Flag and identify correct revision; escalate to document owner
  - Not yet approved: Flag as HOLD; track approval workflow status
  - Outdated (past review date): Flag as HOLD; coordinate with DOC-03 for urgent review
- For documents that do not exist (not yet created):
  - Flag as CRITICAL GAP
  - Identify responsible party and estimated creation timeline
  - Assess if startup can proceed without this document (risk assessment in Step 5)

**Step 5: Gap Analysis & Risk Assessment**
- Compile all gaps from Step 4 into structured gap list
- For each gap, perform risk assessment:
  - **Severity**: What is the worst-case consequence if we proceed without this item?
    - High: Potential for injury, environmental release, or regulatory violation
    - Medium: Potential for equipment damage or operational disruption
    - Low: Administrative non-conformance with no safety impact
  - **Likelihood**: How likely is the gap to cause a problem during startup?
    - High: Gap directly affects startup activities
    - Medium: Gap affects ongoing operation but not immediate startup
    - Low: Gap is administrative/housekeeping
  - **Compensating Measures**: What interim measures can mitigate the risk?
    - Specific, actionable measures (not generic statements)
    - Time-limited (compensating measure has an expiration date)
    - Monitored (someone is responsible for ensuring measure is in place)
- Classify each gap:
  - **HOLD**: Must be resolved before startup. No acceptable compensating measure exists. Examples: safety guard missing, untrained operator assigned to critical task, safety interlock not tested.
  - **CONDITIONAL ACCEPT**: Can proceed with documented compensating measure. Time-limited closure required. Examples: one SOP in final review with experienced operator supervision available; alarm not yet rationalized but manual monitoring in place.
  - **ACCEPT**: Low-risk item that does not affect safe startup. Track for closure but do not delay startup. Examples: final as-built P&ID drafting pending (red-lines are current); spare parts order placed but not yet received for non-critical item.

**Step 6: Consolidate PSSR Package**
- Assemble final PSSR workbook with all sheets
- Generate PSSR summary report document
- Create document verification matrix showing status of every required document
- Compile open items register with risk assessments and compensating measures
- Prepare PSSR walkdown agenda (checklist items requiring physical verification)
- Schedule PSSR review meeting with all team members
- Distribute PSSR package to team members for pre-review (via mcp-sharepoint and mcp-outlook)

### Phase 3: PSSR Execution & Authorization (Steps 7-9)

**Step 7: PSSR Walkdown**
- Conduct physical walkdown of the system with PSSR team
- Verify each walkdown checklist item in the field:
  - Equipment installed per P&ID and design specifications
  - Safety devices in place and functional (safety showers, fire extinguishers, emergency exits)
  - Safety interlocks tested and verified
  - Valve positions match startup lineup requirements
  - Electrical isolation points clearly labeled
  - Warning signs and labels in place
  - Housekeeping acceptable (no construction debris, tripping hazards)
  - Emergency access/egress unobstructed
  - Temporary construction items removed (scaffolding, temporary lighting, laydown areas)
- Document walkdown findings with photos
- Classify findings as HOLD or acceptable
- Update PSSR package with walkdown results

**Step 8: PSSR Review Meeting**
- Conduct formal PSSR review meeting with full team
- Review each checklist category systematically:
  - Present evidence for each item
  - Discuss and resolve any disagreements
  - Reach consensus on PASS/CONDITIONAL/FAIL for each item
  - Document compensating measures for CONDITIONAL items
  - Identify HOLD items requiring resolution
- Make PSSR decision:
  - **APPROVED**: All items PASS or acceptable with low-risk conditions
  - **APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS**: Some items CONDITIONAL; compensating measures documented; time-limited closures assigned. Startup may proceed.
  - **NOT APPROVED**: HOLD items remain unresolved. Startup may NOT proceed. Specify what must be resolved before re-review.
- Document meeting minutes, attendees, decisions, and action items
- Obtain team member signatures on PSSR authorization sheet

**Step 9: Authorization & Close-Out**
- If APPROVED or APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS:
  - Prepare startup authorization memorandum
  - Route for management signatures (Operations Manager, HSE Manager, Plant Manager)
  - Notify all parties of authorization and conditions
  - Issue formal startup authorization to operations team
  - Track conditional item closures:
    - Daily status update on open conditions
    - Escalate overdue conditions to management
    - Close conditions with evidence documentation
    - When all conditions closed, issue unconditional approval
- If NOT APPROVED:
  - Issue formal hold notification with specific requirements for resolution
  - Track resolution of HOLD items
  - Schedule re-review date
  - Repeat Steps 4-8 for HOLD items when resolved
- Archive complete PSSR package:
  - All checklists, evidence documents, meeting minutes, authorization
  - Store in permanent project records (per document retention policy)
  - Register in PSSR tracking database for historical analysis

## Quality Criteria

### Quantitative Thresholds

| Criterion | Target | Minimum Acceptable |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Checklist item coverage (% of applicable items addressed) | 100% | 100% (no skipping items) |
| Document verification accuracy (correct rev, approved, current) | 100% | >99% |
| HOLD item resolution before startup | 100% | 100% (non-negotiable for safety) |
| Conditional item closure within specified timeframe | 100% | >95% |
| PSSR team attendance (all required disciplines represented) | 100% | 100% |
| Walkdown finding documentation (photo evidence) | >90% | >80% |
| Time from PSSR initiation to decision | <14 days | <21 days |
| Open item tracking accuracy | 100% | >99% |
| Historical PSSR data capture (for lessons learned) | 100% | >95% |
| Regulatory compliance verification | 100% | 100% |

### Qualitative Standards

- **Safety First**: No HOLD item may be bypassed or waived without formal risk assessment documented and signed by the Plant Manager and HSE Manager. The PSSR is a safety gate, not a schedule gate.
- **Evidence-Based**: Every checklist item must have traceable evidence documentation. "Verified by observation" is acceptable for walkdown items but must be supported by dated photos and verifier signature.
- **Risk-Based Decision Making**: Conditional approvals must have genuine compensating measures, not administrative workarounds. "We'll fix it later" is not a compensating measure.
- **Multi-Discipline Verification**: No single individual can approve a PSSR alone. The team must include operations, maintenance, HSE, and engineering as minimum.
- **Transparency**: The PSSR decision and all conditions must be clearly communicated to everyone involved in startup operations. No startup should occur with unaware operators.

### Validation Process
1. Pre-PSSR: Verify all required documents are assembled (>95% before scheduling review)
2. During PSSR: Verify all checklist items are addressed (no blank items)
3. Post-PSSR: Verify all signatures obtained, all conditions time-bound, tracking system active
4. Post-Startup: Verify all conditional items closed within specified timeframe
5. Annual: Analyze PSSR findings trends; feed into project execution improvement
