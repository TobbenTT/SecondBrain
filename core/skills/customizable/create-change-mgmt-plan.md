# Create Change Management Plan
## Skill ID: create-change-mgmt-plan
## Version: 1.0.0
## Category: A - Document Generation
## Priority: High

## Purpose
Generates comprehensive change management plans for industrial Operational Readiness projects, addressing the people-side of transitioning from construction/project mode to operational mode. This includes stakeholder analysis, impact assessment, communication strategy, resistance management, leadership alignment, and organizational transition planning.

Change management is often the most underestimated workstream in Operational Readiness. Technical deliverables (procedures, strategies, systems) are necessary but insufficient for successful operations. The human factors - new roles, new ways of working, new skills requirements, organizational restructuring, and cultural shifts - determine whether the technical preparations actually translate into operational performance. Failure to manage change effectively results in resistance, low adoption of new processes, safety incidents, high turnover, and extended ramp-up periods.

## Intent & Specification
The AI agent MUST understand that:

1. **Change Management is Not Optional**: Every OR project involves significant organizational change. Even brownfield expansions create disruption. The change management plan must be a core workstream, not an afterthought.
2. **People-Centric Approach**: The plan must address the concerns, motivations, and resistance of real people - from the plant manager to the most junior operator. One-size-fits-all communication does not work.
3. **Structured Methodology Required**: The plan must follow a recognized change management methodology (ADKAR, Kotter, Prosci, or equivalent) adapted to the industrial context, not ad-hoc activities.
4. **Leadership Sponsorship is Critical**: Without visible, active sponsorship from senior leadership, change initiatives fail. The plan must define specific leadership actions, not just "leadership support."
5. **Communication is Bi-Directional**: Communication is not just broadcasting messages. It includes listening mechanisms (surveys, town halls, feedback loops) to detect resistance and adjust.
6. **Integration with Other Workstreams**: Change management must be woven into training, organizational design, staffing, and operational readiness activities - not executed as a parallel, disconnected stream.
7. **Measurable Outcomes**: Change readiness and adoption must be measured, not assumed. The plan must include change readiness assessments and adoption metrics.
8. **Language**: Spanish (Latin American).

## Methodology & Standards

### Primary Change Management Framework: ADKAR
The ADKAR model (Prosci) provides the individual change framework:

| Element | Definition | Key Activities |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| **A** - Awareness | Understanding WHY the change is happening | Communications explaining the business case |
| **D** - Desire | Personal motivation to participate and support the change | Addressing WIIFM ("What's In It For Me"), resistance management |
| **K** - Knowledge | Understanding HOW to change (skills and knowledge) | Training, education, coaching, mentoring |
| **A** - Ability | Demonstrated capability to implement the change | Practice, OJT, competency verification, support |
| **R** - Reinforcement | Sustaining the change long-term | Recognition, reward, measurement, accountability |

### Supporting Frameworks
| Framework | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Kotter's 8 Steps** | Organizational change sequence (urgency, coalition, vision, communication, empowerment, quick wins, consolidation, anchoring) |
| **Prosci PCT Model** | Project Change Triangle (Leadership/Sponsorship, Project Management, Change Management) |
| **Bridges Transition Model** | Understanding psychological transition (Ending, Neutral Zone, New Beginning) |
| **Stakeholder Theory** | Power/Interest mapping for stakeholder engagement prioritization |

### Change Management Principles for Industrial OR
1. **Safety First**: Any change that could compromise safety must have additional controls and verification
2. **Operational Continuity**: For brownfield projects, change must not disrupt current operations
3. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Mining, oil & gas, and industrial cultures have specific dynamics (shift work, male-dominated, unionized environments)
4. **Geographic Isolation**: Remote site operations have unique communication and engagement challenges
5. **Contractor Integration**: Contractors are often treated as second-class stakeholders but represent 40-60% of the workforce
6. **Practical Over Theoretical**: Industrial workers respond to concrete, practical communication - not corporate jargon
7. **Visible Leadership**: In industrial environments, management presence in the field ("Management By Walking Around") is more powerful than emails

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Assessment & Analysis (Steps 1-4)
1. **Define the Change**: Clearly articulate:
   - What is changing (structure, processes, roles, technology, culture)
   - Why the change is happening (business case, strategic rationale)
   - What the future state looks like (vision)
   - What is NOT changing (anchoring stability)
   - Timeline and key milestones
   - Magnitude assessment (incremental, significant, transformational)
2. **Stakeholder Analysis**: For each stakeholder group:
   - Identify all stakeholder groups (not just leaders)
   - Assess their current state (awareness, attitude, influence, impact)
   - Map on power/interest matrix
   - Classify engagement strategy (manage closely, keep satisfied, keep informed, monitor)
   - Identify key influencers (both positive and negative)
   - Document individual stakeholder concerns and motivations
3. **Impact Assessment**: For each stakeholder group, assess:
   - How their role changes (new responsibilities, removed responsibilities)
   - How their reporting/structure changes
   - How their daily work processes change
   - How their skills/competency requirements change
   - How their working conditions change (schedule, location, environment)
   - Emotional/psychological impact (uncertainty, fear, excitement)
   - Create impact heat map (stakeholder group x impact dimension)
4. **Change Readiness Baseline**: Design and plan:
   - Readiness assessment survey (15-20 questions)
   - Covering: awareness, understanding, willingness, capability, support
   - Scoring methodology (1-5 scale per question, aggregate by ADKAR element)
   - Baseline timing (as early as possible)
   - Comparison points (midpoint, pre-commissioning, post-commissioning)

### Phase 2: Strategy Design (Steps 5-8)
5. **Design Sponsorship Plan**: Define:
   - Executive sponsor role and specific activities
   - Senior leadership coalition members and their roles
   - Middle manager engagement plan (they are critical multipliers)
   - Change champion network (one per department/shift, selected for influence)
   - Sponsor activity calendar (when they need to be visible, speak, act)
6. **Design Communication Strategy**: Create:
   - Communication objectives for each ADKAR phase
   - Key messages tailored to each stakeholder group
   - Channel selection based on audience preferences and site logistics
   - Communication calendar aligned with project milestones
   - Two-way feedback mechanisms
   - FAQ document (anticipate top 20 questions)
   - Communication governance (who approves, who delivers)
7. **Design Resistance Management Plan**: Anticipate and plan for:
   - Common sources of resistance in industrial OR (job security, new skills, changed authority, disruption)
   - Resistance indicators to watch (attendance drops, complaints, grievances, rumor mill)
   - Mitigation strategies per resistance type (information for uncertainty, involvement for loss of control, support for skill anxiety)
   - Escalation path for persistent resistance
   - Role of unions/worker representatives (if applicable)
8. **Design Transition Plan**: Plan the actual changeover:
   - Transition phases (preparation, transition, stabilization)
   - Go/no-go criteria for each phase
   - Parallel operations period (if brownfield)
   - Hypercare/intensive support period post-transition
   - Knowledge transfer mechanisms (project to operations)
   - Cutover checklists

### Phase 3: Detailed Planning (Steps 9-11)
9. **Create Detailed Communication Calendar**: For each month of the project:
   - List all communication activities
   - Specify: date, channel, audience, key messages, responsible person
   - Include preparation time for materials
   - Schedule feedback collection points
   - Plan recognition and celebration events
10. **Define Measurement Framework**: Design how change success is measured:
    - ADKAR scores (from readiness surveys) by stakeholder group
    - Communication effectiveness (reach, comprehension, recall)
    - Adoption metrics (are people using new processes/systems)
    - Engagement metrics (participation in meetings, survey response rates)
    - Resistance metrics (complaints, escalations, turnover intent)
    - Schedule measurement cadence (monthly during implementation)
11. **Develop Risk Register**: Identify change-specific risks:
    - Key person departure during transition
    - Leadership change/loss of sponsorship
    - Union action/industrial relations issues
    - Schedule pressure compressing change timeline
    - Budget cuts reducing change management resources
    - Cultural resistance exceeding expectations
    - For each: assess likelihood x impact, define mitigation, assign owner

### Phase 4: Document Generation & Quality (Steps 12-14)
12. **Generate Change Management Plan (.docx)**: Write the complete plan following the structure defined above.
13. **Generate Communication Strategy (.pptx)**: Create the visual communication strategy presentation.
14. **Quality Review**: Verify completeness, stakeholder coverage, and alignment with project timeline.

### Example: ADKAR Assessment Scoring

| ADKAR Element | Question (example) | Score (1-5) | Gap Action |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Awareness** | I understand why the OR project is necessary | 3.8 | Continue communication on business case |
| **Awareness** | I understand the consequences of not changing | 3.2 | Address "what if we don't change" more explicitly |
| **Desire** | I personally support this change | 3.0 | WIIFM messaging needs strengthening |
| **Desire** | I see personal benefit in the new way of working | 2.8 | Address career path, development opportunities |
| **Knowledge** | I understand what new skills I need to develop | 2.5 | Accelerate training plan communication |
| **Knowledge** | I know where to get help and information | 3.5 | Resources are accessible; maintain |
| **Ability** | I feel confident I can perform in my new role | 2.2 | OJT and simulation training needed |
| **Ability** | I have had enough practice with new processes | 1.8 | Critical gap - increase hands-on practice |
| **Reinforcement** | My achievements in the new way are recognized | N/A | Not yet applicable (pre-change assessment) |

**Interpretation**: Scores below 3.0 indicate gaps requiring targeted intervention. The above example shows the organization is progressing on Awareness but has significant gaps in Knowledge and Ability - pointing to an urgent need to accelerate training and hands-on practice before transition.
