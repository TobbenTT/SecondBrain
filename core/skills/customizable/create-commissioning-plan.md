# Create Commissioning Plan
## Skill ID: A-COMM-PLAN-001
## Version: 1.0.0
## Category: A. Document Generation
## Priority: P1 - Critical

## Purpose

Generate a comprehensive commissioning and startup plan that covers the full spectrum from pre-commissioning through commissioning to Targeted Completion and Certificate of Compliance (TCCC) stages. This skill produces structured plans and schedules that sequence all activities required to safely and systematically bring a plant from mechanical completion to sustained commercial operation.

Commissioning is the critical bridge between project construction and plant operations. A well-structured commissioning plan ensures that all systems are verified, tested, and proven before production begins. Poor commissioning planning is a leading cause of project delays, startup incidents, and extended ramp-up periods. This skill ensures that commissioning activities are logically sequenced, resource-loaded, safety-validated, and aligned with the overall Operational Readiness timeline.

## Intent & Specification

The AI agent MUST understand the following core goals:

1. **Three-Stage Framework**: The plan must clearly delineate the three commissioning stages:
   - **Pre-Commissioning**: Verification activities after mechanical completion (cleaning, flushing, leak testing, alignment checks, megger testing, loop checks). No process fluids or energy introduction.
   - **Commissioning**: Introduction of utilities and process fluids, functional testing of individual equipment and systems, integrated system testing, performance testing. Progressively energizing and loading systems.
   - **TCCC (Targeted Completion / Certificate of Compliance)**: Final performance guarantee testing, sustained operation demonstration, handover from project to operations, deficiency punch-list resolution.

2. **System-Based Approach**: Commissioning must be planned system-by-system (not area-by-area), following process logic sequence. Each system has defined completion milestones (MC, Pre-comm Complete, Comm Complete, Ready for Startup).

3. **Safety-First Sequencing**: All commissioning activities must be safety-validated. HAZOP close-out, PSSR (Pre-Startup Safety Review), and risk assessments must be completed before energization. Lock-out/Tag-out protocols, safe work permits, and isolation management are integral to the plan.

4. **Resource Integration**: The plan must address the overlap period where construction, commissioning, and operations teams coexist, with clear jurisdictional boundaries and handover protocols.

5. **Punch-List Management**: The plan must incorporate a systematic approach to identifying, categorizing (A/B/C), and resolving deficiencies throughout the commissioning process.

## VSC Failure Modes Table Reference

When referencing equipment failure modes in punch lists, pre-commissioning deficiency logs, or commissioning risk assessments, use the official VSC Failure Modes Table (`methodology/standards/VSC_Failure_Modes_Table.xlsx`) for consistent failure classification. Structure: **[WHAT] → [Mechanism] due to [Cause]** (18 mechanisms, 46 causes, 72 combinations).

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Scope & Planning Framework (Steps 1-3)

**Step 1: Define Commissioning Systems**
- Review equipment list and P&IDs to define commissioning systems
- Group equipment into logical commissioning systems based on process function
- Define system boundaries (what equipment is in each system)
- Establish system numbering convention
- Create System Turnover List with scope boundaries

**Step 2: Establish Sequencing Logic**
- Determine utility commissioning sequence (typically: power > air > water > steam > process)
- Map process-logic dependencies between systems
- Identify which systems must be commissioned first to support downstream systems
- Consider construction completion sequence and constraints
- Identify long-lead commissioning activities (e.g., refractory dry-out, catalyst loading)

**Step 3: Define Completion Criteria**
For each stage, define explicit completion criteria:
- **MC Criteria**: Construction complete per drawings, punch-list Category A cleared, QC documentation complete, as-built drawings available
- **Pre-Commissioning Criteria**: All discipline checks complete, certificates signed, punch-list Category B cleared
- **Commissioning Criteria**: Equipment functionally tested, control systems validated, interlocks proven, system integrated
- **TCCC Criteria**: Performance test passed, sustained operation demonstrated, operations team fully deployed, all training complete

### Phase 2: Activity Development (Steps 4-6)

### Phase 3: Schedule Development (Steps 7-8)

**Step 7: Build Commissioning Schedule**
- Assign durations to each activity (based on equipment counts, complexity, and industry benchmarks)
- Link activities with predecessor/successor relationships
- Identify the critical path
- Calculate float for non-critical activities
- Align with master project schedule milestones
- Identify resource constraints and level resources

**Step 8: Resource Loading**

- Estimate commissioning spares requirements
- Prepare budget estimate

### Phase 4: Safety & Documentation (Steps 9-10)

**Step 9: Safety Planning**
- Develop commissioning-specific risk register
- Define SIMOPS management requirements
- Establish permit-to-work requirements for commissioning

## Quality Criteria

### Quantitative Thresholds

| Criterion | Target | Minimum Acceptable |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| System coverage (all equipment in a system) | 100% | 100% |
| Activity coverage per system | >95% of standard activities | >90% |
| Predecessor/successor linkage | 100% of activities linked | >95% |
| Safety requirements per activity | 100% identified | >95% |
| Completion criteria defined per stage | 100% | 100% |
| Vendor support requirements identified | 100% of OEM packages | >90% |
| PSSR checklist completeness | 100% of standard items | 100% |
| SME approval rating | >95% | >91% |

### Qualitative Standards

- **Logical Sequencing**: Pre-commissioning always precedes commissioning, which always precedes TCCC. Utility systems must be commissioned before dependent process systems.
- **Safety Integration**: Every activity involving energy introduction (electrical, mechanical, thermal, chemical) must have associated safety requirements.
- **Completeness**: The plan must cover all systems in the equipment list. No system should be missing from the commissioning scope.
- **Practicality**: Durations must be realistic based on equipment counts and complexity. Critical path must be achievable within the project timeline.
- **Handover Clarity**: The boundary between construction, commissioning, and operations jurisdictions must be unambiguous.

### Validation Process
1. System coverage check (all equipment accounted for)
2. Sequencing logic validation (no circular dependencies, correct process sequence)
3. Critical path feasibility against project timeline
4. Safety requirements completeness check
5. PSSR checklist completeness
6. Resource plan feasibility
7. Final quality score calculation
