# Create Operations Manual
## Skill ID: create-operations-manual
## Version: 2.0.0
## Category: A - Document Generation
## Priority: Critical

## Purpose
Generates comprehensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) and operations manuals for industrial facilities, covering normal operations, startup, shutdown, and emergency procedures. These manuals are the primary reference documents that operating personnel use daily to safely and efficiently operate process equipment and systems.

Operations manuals are a critical deliverable in Operational Readiness. Without properly documented procedures, operators rely on tribal knowledge, which creates safety risks, inconsistent operations, and production losses. Well-crafted operations manuals enable new operators to perform their duties safely and reduce the time to achieve stable operations after commissioning.

## Intent & Specification
The AI agent MUST understand that:

1. **Safety is Paramount**: Every procedure must integrate safety considerations. An operations manual that does not address hazards, protective measures, and emergency responses is fundamentally deficient.
2. **Procedures Must Be Usable in the Field**: Operations manuals are used by operators at the control panel and in the field. Language must be clear, direct, and action-oriented. Avoid verbose engineering descriptions - operators need step-by-step instructions.
3. **Four Operating Modes Required**: Each system requires procedures for:
   - Normal Operation (steady-state monitoring and control)
   - Startup (initial and normal startup sequences)
   - Shutdown (normal and emergency shutdown)
   - Emergency/Abnormal Operations (troubleshooting and response)
4. **System-by-System Organization**: Each process system gets its own manual section or standalone document. A "system" is defined by process boundaries (typically aligned with P&ID sheets).
5. **ISA-5.1 Compliance**: All instrument and control references must follow ISA-5.1 symbology and tag numbering conventions, matching the P&IDs.
6. **Living Documents**: Manuals must be structured for easy updates as operating experience accumulates. Version control and management of change integration are essential.
7. **Language**: Spanish (Latin American), with instrument tags and technical nomenclature maintained in their standard English-origin form as used on P&IDs.

### Procedure Writing Methodology
1. **Process Understanding**: Study P&IDs and process descriptions to understand system function
2. **Safety Layer Identification**: Identify all hazards, interlocks, and protective systems
3. **Operational Logic Mapping**: Map the logical sequence of operations (decision trees for each operating mode)
4. **Parameter Extraction**: Extract all operating parameters, setpoints, alarm values from engineering data
5. **Step-by-Step Development**: Write procedures using the format standard (one action per step, active voice)
6. **HSE Integration**: Integrate safety warnings, PPE requirements, and emergency responses
7. **Cross-Reference Validation**: Verify all tag numbers, setpoints, and equipment references against source documents

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: System Analysis (Steps 1-4)
1. **Parse P&IDs**: Extract from each P&ID:
   - All equipment items (vessels, exchangers, pumps, etc.) with tag numbers
   - All instruments and control devices with tag numbers
   - All control loops and their configurations
   - All safety interlocks and ESD valves
   - All manual valves critical to operation
   - Process streams and interconnections with other systems
2. **Parse Process Description**: Understand:
   - What the system does (function)
   - How it works (process mechanism)
   - Normal operating conditions (T, P, flow, level, composition)
   - Design conditions and limits
   - Feed requirements and product specifications
3. **Extract Operating Parameters**: Build a comprehensive parameter table:
   - For each control loop: setpoint, operating range, alarm setpoints
   - For each equipment: operating limits, design limits
   - For each instrument: range, alarm/trip values
   - For each quality parameter: target, acceptable range
4. **Identify Hazards**: From HAZOP, P&IDs, and process description:
   - Chemical hazards (toxic, flammable, corrosive, reactive)
   - Physical hazards (pressure, temperature, rotating equipment)
   - Environmental hazards (emissions, discharges, noise)
   - Ergonomic hazards (confined spaces, heights, manual handling)

### Phase 2: Procedure Development (Steps 5-8)
5. **Develop Normal Operations Procedure**:
   - Define steady-state monitoring activities
   - Create field round routes and checklists
   - Document routine adjustments and their triggers
   - Define shift handover requirements
   - Include routine sampling and quality checks
6. **Develop Startup Procedures**:
   - Create comprehensive pre-startup checklists
   - Define the startup sequence step-by-step
   - Include first-fill/priming for initial commissioning startup
   - Define hold points for verification
   - Specify criteria for "system is now in normal operation"
7. **Develop Shutdown Procedures**:
   - Normal shutdown: orderly sequence, preservation steps
   - Emergency shutdown: rapid sequence, immediate safety actions
   - Define criteria for different levels of shutdown (partial/full)
   - Post-shutdown activities and system preservation
8. **Develop Abnormal/Emergency Procedures**:
   - Create troubleshooting matrix (symptom > possible cause > action)
   - Document emergency response for each identified scenario
   - Include loss-of-utility responses (power, water, air, steam)
   - Include fire/explosion/release response for this system area

### Phase 3: Safety Integration (Steps 9-10)
9. **Integrate HSE Content**: For every procedure:
   - Add PPE requirements at the beginning
   - Insert safety warnings BEFORE the relevant step
   - Reference safety interlocks and their bypass procedures
   - Include permit-to-work requirements where applicable
   - Add environmental compliance checks
10. **Validate with HSE Agent**: Send procedures to hse-agent for:
    - Verification that all identified hazards are addressed
    - Confirmation of PPE requirements
    - Validation of emergency response procedures
    - Regulatory compliance check

### Phase 4: Document Assembly & Quality (Steps 11-13)
11. **Compile Manual**: Assemble all procedures into the standard manual structure.
12. **Cross-Reference Check**:
    - Every tag number mentioned matches P&ID
    - Every setpoint matches the datasheet or control philosophy
    - Every alarm value matches the alarm rationalization
    - Equipment operating parameters are internally consistent
    - All procedures reference the correct P&ID revision
13. **Readability Review**:
    - Steps are clear and unambiguous
    - No step contains more than one action
    - Conditional logic (IF/THEN) is clearly structured
    - Units are consistently applied
    - Technical terms are used correctly and consistently
