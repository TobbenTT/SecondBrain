# Create Training Plan
## Skill ID: create-training-plan
## Version: 1.0.0
## Category: A - Document Generation
## Priority: High

## Purpose
Generates comprehensive training plans with competency gap analysis for industrial operations and maintenance workforces. This skill identifies the competencies required for each role, assesses the current (or expected) competency levels of the workforce, quantifies the gaps, and designs a structured training program to close those gaps before commissioning and throughout steady-state operations.

Training is one of the most critical and time-constrained Operational Readiness workstreams. Inadequately trained personnel lead to safety incidents, equipment damage, production losses, and extended ramp-up periods. The training plan must be realistic in scope, sequenced correctly (foundational before advanced), and aligned with the workforce buildup schedule.

## Intent & Specification
The AI agent MUST understand that:

1. **Competency-Based Approach**: Training is driven by the gap between required competencies (from role profiles and job tasks) and actual competencies (from workforce assessment). Training fills the gap, nothing more, nothing less.
2. **Gap Analysis is Quantitative**: The gap analysis must produce measurable data - competency scores, gap sizes, training hours required - not vague qualitative statements.
3. **Sequencing Matters**: Training must follow a logical learning path: safety first, then fundamentals, then system-specific, then advanced. Operators cannot learn emergency procedures before they understand normal operations.
4. **Multiple Delivery Methods**: Not all training is classroom-based. The plan must include on-the-job training (OJT), simulator training, vendor training, self-directed learning, mentoring, and competency assessments.
5. **Time Constraints Are Real**: Training must complete before the person needs to perform the role. The schedule must be realistic given the number of trainees, trainer availability, and facility access.
6. **Compliance Training is Non-Negotiable**: Regulatory and safety certifications (first aid, fire fighting, confined space, electrical safety, etc.) must be completed before personnel can work on site.
7. **Language**: Spanish (Latin American).

## Methodology & Standards

### Primary Standards
| Standard | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **ISO 10015** | Quality management - guidelines for competence management and people development |
| **EN 15628** | Maintenance - qualification of maintenance personnel |
| **DS 132 (Chile)** | Mining safety - mandatory training requirements |
| **DS 594 (Chile)** | Workplace safety - health and safety training |
| **ISO 55001** | Asset management - competence requirements |

### Competency-Based Training Development (CBTD) Methodology
1. **Define Competencies**: Identify what knowledge, skills, and abilities are required for each role
2. **Assess Current State**: Evaluate existing competency levels through testing, observation, or self-assessment
3. **Analyze Gaps**: Quantify the difference between required and current competency levels
4. **Design Training**: Create learning interventions targeted at closing specific gaps
5. **Deliver Training**: Execute the training program using appropriate methods
6. **Assess Competency**: Verify that training has achieved the required competency level
7. **Maintain and Improve**: Ongoing refresher training and continuous improvement

### Training Hour Estimation Guidelines
| Gap Size | Training Method | Estimated Hours |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Level 0 to 1 (Awareness) | Classroom / E-learning | 4-8 hours |
| Level 0 to 2 (Basic) | Classroom + OJT | 16-40 hours |
| Level 0 to 3 (Competent) | Classroom + OJT + Practice | 80-200 hours |
| Level 0 to 4 (Proficient) | Above + mentoring + experience | 200-500 hours |
| Level 1 to 3 (two levels) | Classroom + OJT | 40-120 hours |
| Level 2 to 3 (one level) | OJT + Practice | 20-60 hours |
| Level 3 to 4 (one level) | Mentoring + Advanced OJT | 60-200 hours |

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Competency Framework (Steps 1-3)
1. **Define Competency Model**: Create the competency framework:
   - Identify competency categories (Technical, Safety, Behavioral, Systems, Management)
   - Define specific competencies within each category
   - Write clear proficiency level definitions (1-5) for each competency
   - Create the competency dictionary
2. **Map Competencies to Roles**: For each role in the staffing plan:
   - Identify all required competencies
   - Set the target proficiency level for each competency
   - Classify priority (Critical / Important / Desirable)
   - Identify mandatory certifications
3. **Validate Framework**: Cross-check competency requirements against:
   - Operations manual tasks (operators must be competent in all SOPs they execute)
   - Maintenance manual procedures (technicians must be competent in all procedures they perform)
   - Regulatory requirements (mandatory certifications and training)
   - Equipment vendor requirements (OEM-certified training)

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis (Steps 4-6)
4. **Assess Current Competency Levels**:
   - If workforce assessment data is provided: use assessed levels
   - If new hires (greenfield): assume baseline levels based on:
     - Education level provides Level 1 in related technical areas
     - Relevant experience provides Level 2-3 in specific areas
     - Certifications provide Level 3 in certified areas
     - No experience = Level 0
5. **Calculate Gaps**: For each person-competency pair:
   - Gap = Required Level - Current Level
   - Classify: None (0), Minor (1), Moderate (2), Major (3+)
   - Flag critical gaps (safety-related, commissioning-deadline-driven)
6. **Summarize and Prioritize**:
   - Aggregate total training hours by role, department, and competency category
   - Identify top 10 critical gaps across the organization
   - Calculate total training program scope (hours, cost, duration)
   - Identify gaps that cannot be closed by training alone (require recruitment of experienced staff)

### Phase 3: Training Program Design (Steps 7-10)
7. **Design Training Curriculum**: Structure the program into phases:
   - **Phase 1 (Month 1-2)**: HSE induction, regulatory compliance, site orientation
   - **Phase 2 (Month 2-4)**: Process fundamentals, equipment fundamentals, basic systems
   - **Phase 3 (Month 4-7)**: System-specific training (operations/maintenance per system)
   - **Phase 4 (Month 7-9)**: Advanced procedures, abnormal operations, emergency response
   - **Phase 5 (Month 9-12+)**: OJT, supervised practice, competency verification
8. **Design Individual Courses**: For each training need:
   - Course title, code, and description
   - Learning objectives (SMART: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound)
   - Target audience (roles)
   - Duration and delivery method
   - Pre-requisites
   - Assessment method
   - Trainer/provider
   - Materials required
9. **Select Delivery Methods**: Match training to the most effective delivery:
   - Safety/compliance: Classroom + practical exercises
   - Process fundamentals: Classroom + videos + site tours
   - Operating procedures: Classroom + simulator (if available) + OJT
   - Maintenance procedures: Workshop + OJT under supervision
   - Systems (DCS, CMMS): Hands-on lab training
   - Management/behavioral: Workshop + coaching
10. **Build Training Schedule**: Create the master training calendar:
    - Sequence courses respecting pre-requisites
    - Align with workforce buildup (train people as they arrive)
    - Align with commissioning milestones (competent before startup)
    - Balance trainer workload and facility availability
    - Account for concurrent training of multiple groups

### Phase 4: Document Generation & Quality (Steps 11-13)
11. **Generate Gap Analysis Workbook (.xlsx)**: Compile all analysis.
12. **Generate Training Plan Report (.docx)**: Write the narrative document.
13. **Quality Review**: Verify completeness, feasibility, and alignment.
