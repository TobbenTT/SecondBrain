# Create Contract Scope
## Skill ID: create-contract-scope
## Version: 1.0.0
## Category: A - Document Generation
## Priority: High

## Purpose
Generates comprehensive technical specifications (bases tecnicas) for Operations & Maintenance (O&M) service contracts. These documents define the scope, performance requirements, service levels, and technical standards that third-party contractors must meet when providing services to the facility.

Service contracts are a fundamental component of the operations model for any industrial facility. Most operations outsource some portion of their maintenance, specialized services, or support functions. The quality of the technical specification directly determines the quality of service received, the cost-effectiveness of the contract, and the ability to manage contractor performance. Poorly written contract scopes lead to scope disputes, underperformance, cost overruns, and safety incidents.

## Intent & Specification
The AI agent MUST understand that:

1. **Technical Specifications Drive Contract Quality**: The bases tecnicas are the technical heart of the service contract. They define WHAT must be done, to WHAT STANDARD, with WHAT resources, and HOW performance is measured. Commercial terms (pricing, payment, legal) are handled separately by procurement/legal.
2. **Scope Must Be Unambiguous**: Every service, activity, and responsibility must be clearly assigned to either the client or the contractor. Ambiguity leads to scope gaps and disputes.
3. **Performance-Based Where Possible**: Modern service contracts should emphasize outcomes (availability, response time, quality) rather than prescribing inputs (number of people, specific methods). However, some services require prescriptive specifications.
4. **Safety Integration is Mandatory**: Contractor HSE requirements must be explicitly defined, including safety statistics requirements, training, PPE, and compliance with site safety management systems.
5. **KPIs and SLAs Drive Accountability**: Every contract must have measurable Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) with consequences for non-compliance (penalties) and incentives for exceptional performance.
6. **Multiple Contract Types**: Different services require different contract structures: lump sum, unit rate, time & materials, cost-plus, performance-based, etc.
7. **Language**: Spanish (Latin American), with technical terms in standard English where industry convention requires.

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Scope Definition (Steps 1-4)
1. **Define Service Boundaries**: Clearly delineate:
   - What is included in the contractor's scope
   - What remains with the client
   - What is shared (RACI matrix)
   - Physical boundaries (which areas/equipment)
   - Temporal boundaries (working hours, coverage)
2. **Detail Service Requirements**: For each service area:
   - Describe specific activities and deliverables
   - Define frequency and scheduling requirements
   - Specify quality standards and acceptance criteria
   - Identify materials and resources required
   - Note any seasonal or campaign variations
3. **Define HSE Requirements**: Specify:
   - Safety management system requirements
   - Safety training and certification requirements
   - Safety performance targets (LTIFR, TRIFR)
   - Environmental compliance requirements
   - Drug and alcohol policy
   - Incident management requirements
4. **Define Personnel Requirements**:
   - Key personnel positions with qualifications
   - General workforce qualification requirements
   - Shift patterns and coverage requirements
   - Subcontracting restrictions
   - Client approval rights

### Phase 2: Performance Framework (Steps 5-7)
5. **Design KPI Framework**: For each KPI:
   - Define the KPI clearly (what is measured)
   - Specify calculation methodology (formula)
   - Set target, minimum acceptable, and stretch levels
   - Define measurement frequency
   - Specify data source and reporting responsibility
6. **Design SLA Framework**: For response-based services:
   - Define priority levels (critical, urgent, routine, planned)
   - Set response time and resolution time for each priority
   - Define escalation procedures
   - Set SLA compliance targets
7. **Design Penalty/Incentive Regime**:
   - Define penalty triggers (KPI below minimum)
   - Calculate penalty amounts (typically % of monthly invoice)
   - Define incentive triggers (KPI above stretch)
   - Calculate incentive amounts (shared savings, bonus)
   - Set overall penalty cap (typically 10-15% of monthly fee)
   - Set incentive cap

### Phase 3: Document Generation (Steps 8-10)
8. **Generate Contract Specification (.docx)**: Write the complete document following the structure defined above.
9. **Generate Appendices**: Create all supporting appendices:
   - Equipment lists, site layouts, KPI formulas
   - Report templates, pricing schedules
   - RACI matrix
10. **Quality Review**: Verify completeness, clarity, and internal consistency.
