# Create Risk Assessment
## Skill ID: A-RISK-ASSESS-001
## Version: 1.0.0
## Category: A. Document Generation
## Priority: P1 - Critical

## Purpose

Generate comprehensive operational risk assessments using bow-tie methodology and risk matrices to identify, analyze, and evaluate risks associated with plant operations, equipment failures, and process hazards. This skill transforms process hazard information, HAZOP results, and operational procedures into structured risk assessment outputs that enable informed decision-making on risk controls, mitigation measures, and residual risk acceptance.

Operational risk assessment is a fundamental requirement for Operational Readiness. It ensures that all significant risks are identified before operations commence, that appropriate barriers (preventive and mitigative) are in place, and that residual risks are within the organization's risk tolerance. The bow-tie methodology provides a visual, intuitive representation of threat-barrier-consequence relationships that is accessible to both technical and management audiences.

## Intent & Specification

The AI agent MUST understand the following core goals:

1. **Bow-Tie Analysis**: Each significant hazard must be analyzed using the bow-tie model: identify the Top Event (loss of control), map Threats (causes) on the left side with Preventive Barriers, and map Consequences on the right side with Mitigative Barriers. Each barrier must have defined Escalation Factors and Escalation Factor Barriers.

2. **Risk Matrix Evaluation**: All identified risks must be evaluated using a standardized risk matrix (typically 5x5 or 6x6) that assesses Likelihood and Consequence across multiple consequence categories (Safety, Environment, Production, Financial, Reputation). Both inherent risk (without controls) and residual risk (with controls) must be assessed.

3. **Barrier Quality Assessment**: Each barrier (control measure) must be evaluated for its effectiveness, independence, and auditability. Degraded or missing barriers must be flagged as action items.

4. **ALARP Demonstration**: The assessment must demonstrate that risks have been reduced to As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP), with clear justification for residual risk acceptance.

5. **Actionable Outputs**: The assessment must produce clear, trackable action items for barrier gaps, risk reduction measures, and monitoring requirements.

## VSC Failure Modes Table Reference

When identifying equipment failure modes as threats in bow-tie analyses or risk registers, reference the official VSC Failure Modes Table (`methodology/standards/VSC_Failure_Modes_Table.xlsx`). All equipment failure threats should use the standard structure: **[WHAT] → [Mechanism] due to [Cause]** (18 mechanisms, 46 causes, 72 combinations).

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Context & Scope Definition (Steps 1-2)

**Step 1: Define Assessment Context**
- Confirm assessment scope boundaries (which systems, areas, phases)
- Identify the risk matrix to be used (client standard or VSC default)
- Determine applicable regulations and standards
- Identify consequence categories relevant to the project
- Confirm risk acceptance criteria and ALARP thresholds

**Step 2: Gather and Review Input Data**
- Ingest HAZOP results, P&IDs, operating procedures
- Review equipment list and criticality data
- Review incident/accident data for likelihood calibration
- Identify hazardous materials and their properties
- Map regulatory compliance obligations

### Phase 2: Hazard Identification (Steps 3-4)

**Step 3: Identify Hazards and Top Events**
For each system/area in scope:
- Identify major hazards (energy sources, hazardous materials, operating conditions)
- Define Top Events (loss of control scenarios):
  - Loss of containment (LOC)
  - Loss of structural integrity
  - Fire/explosion
  - Toxic release
  - Environmental release
  - Equipment failure (critical)
  - Utility failure (power, water, air, steam)
  - Control system failure
- Link to HAZOP deviations where available

**Step 4: Threat and Consequence Analysis**
For each Top Event, develop the bow-tie:

**Left Side (Threats/Causes)**:
- Equipment failure modes (mechanical, electrical, instrumentation)
- Human error (operational, maintenance, procedural)
- External events (weather, seismic, third-party)
- Process deviations (pressure, temperature, flow, level)
- Management system failures (MOC, training, competency)

**Right Side (Consequences)**:
- Safety consequences (personnel injury/fatality)
- Environmental consequences (spills, emissions, contamination)
- Production consequences (downtime, throughput loss)
- Financial consequences (repair costs, penalties, liability)
- Reputational consequences (community, regulatory, media)

### Phase 3: Barrier Identification & Assessment (Steps 5-6)

**Step 5: Identify Barriers**
For each threat-top event-consequence pathway:

**Preventive Barriers** (prevent top event from occurring):
- Hardware barriers: relief valves, trip systems, containment, SIS
- Software barriers: control system interlocks, alarms, automation
- Procedural barriers: SOPs, permit-to-work, checklists
- Competency barriers: training, certification, supervision

**Mitigative Barriers** (reduce consequences after top event):
- Hardware barriers: bund walls, fire suppression, emergency shutdown
- Software barriers: emergency alarms, automatic isolation
- Procedural barriers: Emergency Response Plan, evacuation procedures
- Competency barriers: emergency response training, drills

**Step 6: Assess Barrier Quality**
For each barrier, evaluate:
- **Effectiveness**: Does the barrier reliably prevent/mitigate? (High/Medium/Low)
- **Independence**: Is the barrier independent of the initiating cause? (Yes/No)
- **Auditability**: Can the barrier's performance be tested and verified? (Yes/No)
- **Status**: Is the barrier currently in place, planned, or a gap?

Identify Escalation Factors for each barrier:
- What could cause the barrier to fail?
- What controls exist for escalation factors?

### Phase 4: Risk Evaluation (Steps 7-8)

**Step 7: Assess Inherent and Residual Risk**
For each risk scenario:

**Inherent Risk** (assumes no barriers):
- Assign Likelihood score (1-5) based on threat frequency without controls
- Assign Consequence score (1-5) for each consequence category, using the most severe
- Calculate inherent risk score = Likelihood x Consequence
- Determine inherent risk level from matrix

**Residual Risk** (considers existing barriers):
- Reassess Likelihood considering preventive barriers
- Reassess Consequence considering mitigative barriers
- Apply barrier effectiveness adjustments
- Calculate residual risk score
- Determine residual risk level from matrix

**Step 8: ALARP Assessment**
For each risk with residual level of Medium or above:
- Assess whether further risk reduction is reasonably practicable
- Document justification for residual risk acceptance
- Identify any additional measures that could further reduce risk
- Evaluate cost-benefit of additional measures
- Classify as: ALARP / Not ALARP / Requires Review

### Phase 5: Output Generation (Steps 9-11)

**Step 9: Generate Bow-Tie Diagrams**
For each Top Event, create a text-based bow-tie diagram:
```
THREATS          PREVENTIVE BARRIERS    TOP EVENT    MITIGATIVE BARRIERS    CONSEQUENCES
[Threat 1] ---> [Barrier A] --------\                /--- [Barrier X] ---> [Safety impact]
[Threat 2] ---> [Barrier B] ---------\  [TOP EVENT] /---- [Barrier Y] ---> [Env. impact]
[Threat 3] ---> [Barrier C] ---------->  HAZARD    <----- [Barrier Z] ---> [Prod. impact]
                [Barrier D] ---------/              \---- [Barrier W] ---> [Financial]
```

**Step 10: Compile Risk Register and Matrices**
- Populate all sheets in the risk register workbook
- Generate risk matrix heat map
- Compile action tracker from all barrier gaps and recommendations
- Calculate summary statistics

**Step 11: Generate Assessment Report**
- Write narrative report following the specified structure
- Include bow-tie diagrams, risk matrices, and supporting analysis
- Prepare executive summary with key findings
- Document assumptions, limitations, and review requirements

## Quality Criteria

### Quantitative Thresholds

| Criterion | Target | Minimum Acceptable |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| Hazard identification coverage | 100% of in-scope systems | >95% |
| Bow-tie completeness (threats + consequences per top event) | >5 each | >3 each |
| Barrier identification per pathway | >3 barriers | >2 barriers |
| Barrier quality assessment coverage | 100% | >95% |
| ALARP assessment for Medium+ risks | 100% | 100% |
| Risk owner assignment | 100% | >95% |
| Action items for barrier gaps | 100% of gaps have actions | 100% |
| SME approval rating | >95% | >91% |

### Qualitative Standards

- **Bow-Tie Integrity**: Every bow-tie must have a clearly defined hazard, top event, at least 3 threats, at least 3 consequences, and barriers on both sides.
- **Barrier Independence**: At least one barrier per pathway must be independent of the initiating cause.
- **Risk Calibration**: Likelihood and consequence scores must be calibrated against the defined scales with justification.
- **ALARP Rigor**: ALARP assessments must provide genuine analysis, not boilerplate justification.
- **Actionability**: Every High and Extreme residual risk must have specific, trackable action items with owners and due dates.
- **Traceability**: Every risk must be traceable to its source (HAZOP deviation, process hazard, regulatory requirement).

### Validation Process
1. Bow-tie structural validation (all elements present)
2. Risk scoring consistency check (similar scenarios scored similarly)
3. Barrier gap to action item traceability
4. ALARP justification review
5. Cross-reference with HAZOP completeness
6. Final quality score calculation
