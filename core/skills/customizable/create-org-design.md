# Create Organizational Design
## Skill ID: create-org-design
## Version: 1.0.0
## Category: A - Document Generation
## Priority: High

## Purpose
Generates comprehensive organizational designs for industrial operations and maintenance organizations, including organizational charts, RACI matrices, role definitions, and reporting structures. The organizational design defines HOW the workforce is structured, how decisions are made, how work flows between functional areas, and how accountability is distributed.

Organizational design is foundational to Operational Readiness because it precedes and informs staffing plans, training plans, and the overall operating model. A poorly designed organization creates confusion about roles and responsibilities, duplicated effort, communication breakdowns, slow decision-making, and accountability gaps that ultimately compromise safety and operational performance.

## Intent & Specification
The AI agent MUST understand that:

1. **Organization Follows Strategy**: The organizational structure must be designed to execute the operations and maintenance strategy, not the other way around. If the strategy emphasizes reliability-centered maintenance, the organization must have reliability engineering capability.
2. **Spans of Control Matter**: Management layers and spans of control must be appropriate for the industry and operating environment. Mining operations typically use wider spans than petrochemical plants due to different complexity levels.
3. **RACI is Essential**: A RACI matrix (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) for all key processes and decisions eliminates ambiguity about who does what. This is one of the most critical outputs.
4. **Multiple Views Required**: The organization must be presented as:
   - Hierarchical org chart (reporting lines)
   - Functional matrix (cross-functional relationships)
   - RACI matrix (process-based accountability)
   - Shift organization (who is on site at any given time)
5. **Context-Dependent Design**: Organization design varies significantly by industry, company culture, size, operating model (owner-operator vs. contractor-operated), and regulatory environment.
6. **Interface Management**: The design must clearly define interfaces between Operations, Maintenance, HSE, Engineering, Supply Chain, and support functions.
7. **Language**: Spanish (Latin American).

### RACI Rules
- **R (Responsible)**: Does the work. Multiple R's allowed.
- **A (Accountable)**: Ultimately answerable. Exactly ONE per activity. The "buck stops here."
- **C (Consulted)**: Provides input before decision/action. Two-way communication.
- **I (Informed)**: Notified after decision/action. One-way communication.
- Every activity MUST have exactly ONE A
- Every activity MUST have at least ONE R
- A and R can be the same person
- Minimize C's and I's to avoid decision bottlenecks

## Methodology & Standards

### Primary Standards
| Standard | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| **ISO 55001** | Asset management - organizational requirements |
| **EN 15628** | Maintenance qualification of personnel - role definitions |
| **ISO 45001** | OHS management - safety role requirements |
| **DS 40 (Chile)** | Experto en Prevencion de Riesgos requirement |
| **DS 132 (Chile)** | Mining safety - organizational requirements |

### Organizational Design Principles
1. **Clear Line of Sight**: Every employee should understand how their role contributes to the facility's objectives
2. **Single Point of Accountability**: Every process, equipment, and decision has one clearly accountable person
3. **Appropriate Span of Control**:
   - Management: 5-8 direct reports
   - Supervision (operations): 6-10 operators per shift supervisor
   - Supervision (maintenance): 8-12 technicians per supervisor
4. **Minimum Layers**: Fewer management layers = faster decision-making
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Operations (run the plant), Maintenance (maintain the assets), HSE (govern safety), Planning (optimize resources)
6. **Matrix where Needed**: Reliability engineering, planning, and HSE may have matrix (dotted-line) relationships
7. **Scalability**: Design should accommodate growth without major restructuring

### Common Organizational Models

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Analysis & Design Principles (Steps 1-3)
1. **Analyze Operating Model**: Understand:
   - Operating philosophy (owner-operated, contractor-operated, hybrid)
   - Operating pattern (24/7, shift work, day shift only)
   - Level of automation (highly automated = fewer operators)
   - Geographic layout (compact vs. spread)
   - Complexity (single vs. multiple process areas)
   - Corporate structure and reporting upward
2. **Define Design Principles**: Establish:
   - Span of control targets
   - Management layers target
   - In-house vs. outsourced functions
   - Matrix vs. hierarchical for specific functions
   - Decision-making authority framework
   - Key interfaces and their management
3. **Select Organizational Model**: Based on analysis:
   - Evaluate candidate models (functional, area-based, integrated)
   - Consider client's management philosophy and culture
   - Benchmark against comparable facilities
   - Select optimal model with rationale

### Phase 2: Structure Development (Steps 4-7)
4. **Design Overall Structure**: Create the top-level organization:
   - Plant Manager and direct reports
   - Department structure
   - Reporting lines (solid and dotted)
   - Key positions and their placement
5. **Design Department Structures**: For each department:
   - Internal hierarchy and reporting
   - Roles and positions
   - Shift vs. day roles
   - Contractor positions and their interface
6. **Design Shift Organization**: For each shift:
   - Minimum shift crew composition
   - Authority and decision-making during shifts
   - On-call support arrangements
   - Emergency response organization overlay
   - Shift handover participants
7. **Define Interfaces**: Document how departments interact:
   - Operations-Maintenance interface (work request, execution, handback)
   - Operations-HSE interface (permit management, incident response)
   - Maintenance-Supply Chain interface (parts procurement, inventory)
   - All functions-Management interface (reporting, escalation)

### Phase 3: RACI Development (Steps 8-10)
8. **Identify Key Processes**: List all major processes requiring RACI definition:
   - Operational processes (startup, shutdown, normal ops, emergency)
   - Maintenance processes (planning, scheduling, execution, closeout)
   - HSE processes (risk assessment, incident management, compliance)
   - Cross-functional processes (turnarounds, projects, budgeting)
   - Administrative processes (recruitment, training, performance management)
9. **Assign RACI**: For each process:
   - Determine who is Accountable (exactly one)
   - Determine who is Responsible (at least one)
   - Determine who must be Consulted
   - Determine who must be Informed
   - Validate: no gaps, no excessive C/I assignments
10. **Validate RACI**: Run validation checks:
    - Every row has exactly one A
    - Every row has at least one R
    - No role is overloaded with A assignments (bottleneck risk)
    - No activity has more than 3 C assignments (decision delay risk)
    - Cross-check with org chart (RACI assignments match reporting lines)

### Phase 4: Document Generation & Quality (Steps 11-13)
11. **Generate Org Charts (.pptx)**: Create all organizational charts following the visual standards.
12. **Generate RACI Matrix (.xlsx)**: Compile all RACI sheets with validation.
13. **Quality Review**: Verify alignment between org charts and RACI, completeness, and benchmark comparison.
