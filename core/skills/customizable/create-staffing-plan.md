# Create Staffing Plan
## Skill ID: create-staffing-plan
## Version: 1.0.0
## Category: A - Document Generation
## Priority: High

## Purpose
Generates comprehensive staffing plans for industrial operations and maintenance organizations, defining the number of personnel, roles, competency profiles, shift patterns, and progressive buildup schedules required to safely and efficiently operate and maintain a facility from commissioning through steady-state operations.

The staffing plan is a critical Operational Readiness deliverable because it drives recruitment timelines, training program design, labor budgets, and organizational structure. An under-staffed facility compromises safety and production; an over-staffed facility wastes resources. The plan must balance operational coverage requirements with economic efficiency, regulatory compliance, and workforce availability constraints.

## Intent & Specification
The AI agent MUST understand that:

1. **Staffing is Derived, Not Assumed**: Staffing numbers must be calculated from workload analysis, not assumed from benchmarks alone. Workload drivers include: operating rounds, control room manning, maintenance labor hours, administrative tasks, and statutory requirements.
2. **Shift Pattern Design is Critical**: The shift roster must provide 24/7/365 coverage (or the required operating pattern) while complying with labor regulations (maximum hours, rest periods, overtime limits) and accounting for leave, training, and absenteeism.
3. **Buildup Schedule Required**: For greenfield projects, staffing does not start at full strength. A phased buildup aligned with the project construction and commissioning schedule is essential.
4. **Competency-Based**: Each role must have defined competency requirements (technical, behavioral, certifications) that link to the training plan.
5. **Total Workforce Includes All Categories**: Own staff, contractors, outsourced services, and shared services must all be accounted for.
6. **Regulatory Compliance**: Chilean labor law (Codigo del Trabajo), mining safety regulations (DS 132), and other applicable regulations constrain shift patterns, working hours, and qualification requirements.
7. **Language**: Spanish (Latin American).

## Methodology & Standards

### Primary Standards and Regulations
| Standard/Regulation | Application |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **Codigo del Trabajo (Chile)** | Maximum work hours, rest periods, overtime, night work |
| **DS 132** | Mining safety regulations - minimum staffing for safety |
| **DS 594** | Workplace health and environmental conditions |
| **ISO 55001** | Asset management - maintenance organization requirements |
| **EN 15628** | Maintenance qualification of maintenance personnel |

### Staffing Calculation Methodology

#### Operations Staffing Formula:
```
Operating Headcount = (Positions per Shift) x (Number of Crews) x (Relief Factor)

Where:
- Positions per Shift = derived from workload analysis (rounds, monitoring, response)
- Number of Crews = depends on shift pattern (typically 4 for 24/7 continental)
- Relief Factor = 1 / (Available shifts / Total shifts per year)
  Typically 1.15 - 1.25 accounting for:
  - Annual leave (15-20 days)
  - Training (10-15 days)
  - Sick leave (5-8 days)
  - Public holidays (varies by country)
```

#### Maintenance Staffing Formula:
```
Maintenance Headcount = (Annual Maintenance Hours) / (Available Hours per Technician x Wrench Time Factor)

Where:
- Annual Maintenance Hours = from RCM/FMECA strategy (PM + estimated CM)
- Available Hours per Technician = ~1,800 hrs/year (after leave, training, etc.)
- Wrench Time Factor = 0.35 - 0.55 (proportion of productive maintenance work)
  Non-wrench time includes: travel, permits, parts collection, breaks, admin
- Add: Planning/Scheduling = 1 planner per 15-20 technicians
- Add: Supervision = 1 supervisor per 8-12 technicians
```

#### Shift Patterns Commonly Used
| Pattern | Cycle | Crews | Avg Hours/Week | Common Application |
|---------|-------|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| 4x4 Continental | 16 days | 4 | 42 hrs | Mining, continuous process |
| 7x7 | 14 days | 2 | 42 hrs | Remote mining (FIFO) |
| 4x3 (12-hr shifts) | 7 days | 4 | 42 hrs | Process plants |
| 5x2 (day shift only) | 7 days | 1 | 45 hrs | Day-only maintenance |
| 8x6 | 14 days | 2 | 40 hrs | Mining (regulatory driven) |
| 10x10 | 20 days | 2 | 42 hrs | Remote operations |

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Data Gathering & Analysis (Steps 1-3)
1. **Compile Organizational Framework**: From org design inputs:
   - Identify all departments and functional areas
   - Map reporting lines and spans of control
   - Identify roles that are already defined vs. those to be created
   - Note any client-mandated staffing constraints
2. **Analyze Operating Workload**: From operations manuals and process requirements:
   - Inventory all operating tasks (control room, field, sampling, admin)
   - Estimate time per task and frequency
   - Calculate total operating hours by area and role
   - Identify minimum simultaneous manning requirements (e.g., always 2 operators in control room)
   - Account for geographic spread (travel time between areas)
3. **Analyze Maintenance Workload**: From RCM/maintenance strategy:
   - Sum annual PM hours by craft (mechanical, electrical, instrumentation, civil)
   - Estimate CM hours (typically 30-50% of total, depending on equipment age/condition)
   - Add project/modification work hours (typically 10-15% of total)
   - Add shutdown/turnaround maintenance requirements
   - Calculate net maintenance hours by craft category

### Phase 2: Shift Pattern & Manning Calculation (Steps 4-7)
4. **Design Shift Pattern**:
   - Determine operating pattern requirement (24/7, 5-day, seasonal)
   - Select candidate shift patterns based on regulations and best practices
   - Evaluate each option against: regulatory compliance, fatigue management, employee preference, cost
   - Recommend optimal shift pattern with rationale
   - Calculate number of crews required
5. **Calculate Relief Factor**:
   - Start with annual calendar days (365)
   - Subtract: annual leave, public holidays, sick leave allowance, training days
   - Calculate available working days per person per year
   - Relief factor = Total shift positions needed / Available staffing
   - Typical range: 1.15 - 1.28
6. **Calculate Operations Headcount**:
   - For each operating area, determine positions per shift
   - Apply crew count from shift pattern
   - Apply relief factor
   - Add day-shift-only positions (supervision, planning, coordination)
   - Sum to total operations headcount
7. **Calculate Maintenance Headcount**:
   - For each craft, apply the maintenance staffing formula
   - Select appropriate wrench time factor (benchmark: 35% for reactive, 55% for mature organization)
   - Add planning/scheduling positions
   - Add supervision positions
   - Add specialist positions (reliability engineer, CBM technician)
   - Sum to total maintenance headcount

### Phase 3: Buildup & Cost (Steps 8-10)
8. **Design Workforce Buildup Schedule**:
   - Align with project commissioning schedule
   - Management and supervision: hire 18-24 months before operations
   - Senior operators/technicians: hire 12-15 months (to participate in construction/commissioning)
   - Operators/technicians: hire 6-12 months (for training program)
   - Support staff: hire 3-6 months before operations
   - Create month-by-month buildup curve
9. **Define Role Profiles**: For each unique role:
   - Job title and reporting relationship
   - Key responsibilities (5-8 bullet points)
   - Education requirements
   - Experience requirements
   - Certifications required
   - Technical competencies
   - Behavioral competencies
   - Career path and progression
10. **Estimate Costs**:
    - Apply salary ranges by position and location
    - Add benefits burden (social security, health insurance, bonuses, etc.)
    - Calculate fully loaded annual cost per position
    - Project total annual labor cost at steady state
    - Project buildup period costs (partial years)

### Phase 4: Document Generation & Quality (Steps 11-13)
11. **Generate Staffing Matrix (.xlsx)**: Compile all calculations into the workbook structure.
12. **Generate Staffing Plan Report (.docx)**: Write the narrative document with analysis, methodology, and recommendations.
13. **Quality Review**: Verify calculations, benchmark alignment, regulatory compliance.
