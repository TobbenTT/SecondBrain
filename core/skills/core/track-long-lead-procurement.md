## Purpose

Track long-lead procurement items critical to the commissioning timeline, providing real-time visibility into purchase order status, supplier manufacturing progress, logistics milestones, and delivery risk. This skill monitors all procurement items with lead times exceeding 16 weeks, generates automated alerts when delivery dates are at risk, triggers expediting workflows when delays threaten critical path activities, and identifies alternative sourcing options when primary suppliers cannot meet schedule requirements.

Long-lead procurement items are the hidden schedule killers of capital projects. While engineering and construction schedules receive constant scrutiny, procurement of long-lead items -- large rotating equipment, specialized forgings, custom electrical equipment, proprietary instrumentation, and critical spare parts -- operates on timelines that can extend 12-24 months from order placement to site delivery. These items intersect with the Operational Readiness program in two critical ways:

1. **Equipment for commissioning:** The primary equipment itself must be on-site, installed, and ready for commissioning according to the project schedule. Late delivery of a single major item (e.g., the main transformer, a critical pump, a DCS controller) can delay the entire commissioning sequence.

2. **Spare parts for operations:** Insurance spares and commissioning spares (generated by K-01) include long-lead items that must be available before the first startup. A plant cannot safely commission without spare gearboxes, replacement impellers, backup transformers, and other critical components in the warehouse.

The consequences of untracked procurement are quantified in multiple industry studies. IPA benchmarking data shows that procurement delays account for 15-25% of all project schedule overruns. The average cost of a one-month delay on a major capital project ranges from $5M (mid-size projects) to $50M+ (megaprojects) when factoring in idle workforce, interest during construction, and deferred revenue. For Operational Readiness specifically, Pain Point D-04 documents that 30-40% of initial spare parts arrive late for commissioning, creating dangerous gaps in the asset's ability to respond to equipment failures during the critical ramp-up period.

This skill serves as the "radar system" for procurement, providing continuous tracking of every long-lead item from purchase order issuance through vendor manufacturing, quality inspection, shipping, customs clearance, and site receipt. It integrates with the OR Orchestrator (H-01) to provide procurement readiness data for gate reviews, with the ramp-up model (H-04) for readiness scoring, and with generate-initial-spares-list (K-01) for spare parts delivery monitoring.

## Intent & Specification

The AI agent MUST understand and execute the following core objectives:

1. **Long-Lead Item Register Management**: Maintain a comprehensive register of all procurement items with lead times exceeding 16 weeks, including equipment, spare parts, materials, chemicals, and specialized services. The register is the single source of truth for procurement status across the project.

2. **Purchase Order Tracking**: Monitor PO status through defined procurement milestones: PO issuance, vendor acknowledgment, engineering/drawing submission, drawing approval, raw material procurement, manufacturing start, manufacturing completion, factory acceptance test (FAT), shipping, customs clearance, site delivery, and site receipt/inspection. Each milestone has a planned date and an actual/forecast date.

3. **Supplier Progress Monitoring**: For high-value and critical items, track vendor manufacturing progress through periodic expediting reports, factory visit data, and direct communication with vendor project managers. Detect schedule slippage early through trend analysis of vendor milestone reporting.

4. **Automated Alert System**: Generate alerts at predefined thresholds:
   - **Watch (Yellow):** Vendor milestone slipping 1-2 weeks from plan
   - **Alert (Orange):** Vendor milestone slipping >2 weeks, or cumulative slippage trending toward delivery delay
   - **Critical (Red):** Delivery date at risk of missing required-on-site date, or critical path activity affected
   - **Emergency (Purple):** Confirmed delivery delay that will delay commissioning or operations start

5. **Expediting Trigger & Workflow**: When alerts reach Orange or Red level, automatically initiate expediting workflow: contact vendor for recovery plan, assess alternative shipping methods (air freight vs. sea freight), evaluate partial delivery options, and escalate to procurement management for decision.

6. **Alternative Sourcing Analysis**: When primary vendor cannot meet delivery requirements, identify and evaluate alternative sources: other approved vendors, substitute materials or equipment, used/refurbished options, rental/temporary solutions, and design modifications that eliminate the requirement.

7. **Logistics Coordination**: Track shipping and logistics milestones: ex-works date, freight booking, vessel/aircraft scheduling, port of origin clearance, transit tracking, port of destination clearance, customs release, inland transport, and site delivery. Coordinate with shipping agents and customs brokers.

8. **Integration with Project Schedule**: Link procurement deliveries to project construction and commissioning milestones. When a delivery date changes, automatically assess the impact on downstream activities and update the project team.

## Methodology & Standards

### Long-Lead Item Classification

| Category | Lead Time | Examples | Tracking Intensity |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------------------|
| Ultra-Long Lead (ULL) | >52 weeks | Large transformers, custom forgings, specialty alloys, large gearboxes | Weekly vendor contact, monthly factory visits |
| Long Lead (LL) | 26-52 weeks | Standard motors >1MW, pumps >500HP, control valves, DCS systems | Bi-weekly vendor contact, quarterly factory visits |
| Medium Lead (ML) | 16-26 weeks | Standard instruments, small motors, standard valves, piping specials | Monthly vendor contact |
| Short Lead - Tracked (SLT) | 8-16 weeks | Items on critical path or with history of vendor delays | Monthly vendor contact |

### Procurement Milestone Framework

Standard 13-milestone framework for long-lead items:

```
M1: PO Issued -> M2: Vendor Acknowledgment (5 business days)
  -> M3: Engineering/Drawings Submitted (varies by item)
    -> M4: Drawings Approved by Purchaser (10-15 business days)
      -> M5: Raw Materials Procured by Vendor (4-12 weeks)
        -> M6: Manufacturing Started
          -> M7: Manufacturing Completed
            -> M8: Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) Completed
              -> M9: Shipped Ex-Works
                -> M10: Arrived at Destination Port
                  -> M11: Customs Cleared
                    -> M12: Delivered to Site
                      -> M13: Received and Inspected at Site
```

### Alert Escalation Matrix

| Alert Level | Trigger Criteria | Notification | Response Time | Authority |
|------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| Watch (Yellow) | Milestone 1-2 weeks late; vendor forecasts slight delay | Procurement lead | 1 week | Procurement lead requests vendor recovery plan |
| Alert (Orange) | Milestone >2 weeks late; delivery date at risk | Procurement Manager + Project Manager | 3 business days | Expediting initiated; alternative analysis started |
| Critical (Red) | Delivery will miss required-on-site date; commissioning affected | Project Director + OR Manager | 24 hours | Air freight evaluation; alternative sourcing; schedule impact analysis |
| Emergency (Purple) | Confirmed delay will delay commissioning start or operations | VP Operations + Project Director | Immediate | Emergency procurement authority; schedule re-baseline; executive decision |

### Expediting Decision Framework

```
When delivery delay is confirmed:

1. Assess impact: Is the item on the critical path to commissioning?
   - YES: Proceed to Step 2
   - NO: Monitor and track; inform relevant teams

2. Evaluate vendor recovery:
   - Can vendor accelerate? Additional shifts, subcontracting, parallel processing?
   - Recovery cost? Who bears cost (vendor if contractual obligation, purchaser if acceleration)?

3. Evaluate logistics acceleration:
   - Sea freight -> Air freight: +$X cost, saves Y weeks
   - Partial shipment: Can completed portions ship while remainder continues?
   - Alternative routing: Faster customs clearance, closer port?

4. Evaluate alternative sourcing:
   - Alternative vendor available? Lead time? Cost premium?
   - Substitute/equivalent product available? Technical validation needed?
   - Used/refurbished option? Warranty implications?

5. Evaluate schedule adjustment:
   - Can commissioning sequence be re-ordered to accommodate delay?
   - Can other systems be commissioned first while waiting?
   - What is the cost of delaying commissioning by X weeks?

6. Decision: Choose option with best NPV considering:
   - Expediting cost (air freight, premium charges, overtime)
   - Production delay cost ($X/month of delayed operations)
   - Risk of alternative (quality risk, warranty risk, compatibility risk)
```

### Industry Standards

- **INCOTERMS 2020**: Standard trade terms governing transfer of risk and responsibility in international procurement
- **ISO 9001:2015**: Quality management -- vendor qualification and inspection requirements
- **ASME/API/IEEE codes**: Equipment-specific manufacturing and testing standards that define FAT requirements
- **Chilean customs regulations**: Import procedures, duty rates, and documentation requirements for industrial equipment

### Pain Points Addressed

| Pain Point | Statistic | How Addressed | Expected Impact |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| D-04: Spares Arrive Late | 30-40% late for commissioning | Systematic tracking with early warning alerts | Reduce late deliveries to <10% |
| OG-01: CAPEX-OPEX Delay | 12-24 month transition delay | Early detection of procurement delays affecting commissioning | 2-4 month schedule protection |
| M-02: Cost Overruns | 80% of megaprojects over budget | Proactive expediting vs. reactive crisis management | Reduce expediting costs 40-60% |
| CE-02: Turnaround Overruns | 10-30% overrun on shutdowns | Long-lead parts for turnarounds tracked systematically | Reduce turnaround procurement delays |

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Register Setup & Baseline (Steps 1-4)

**Step 1: Build Long-Lead Item Register**
1. Query mcp-erp for all POs with delivery lead time >16 weeks (or remaining delivery time >12 weeks)
2. Query generate-initial-spares-list (K-01) for spare parts with lead time >16 weeks
3. For each item, capture: PO number, line item, description, equipment tag, vendor, quantity, PO value, PO date, promised delivery date
4. Determine required-on-site date for each item:
   - Equipment: per construction/installation schedule from mcp-project-online
   - Spare parts: per commissioning timeline (insurance spares: T-2 months, commissioning spares: T-1 month)
5. Calculate schedule margin: required-on-site minus promised delivery date
   - Positive margin: item has float
   - Negative margin: item is already at risk
6. Classify items by tracking intensity (ULL, LL, ML, SLT)
7. Assign expediting responsibility for each item
8. Publish register to mcp-sharepoint

**Step 2: Establish Milestone Plans**
1. For each item, create planned milestone dates:
   - Work backwards from promised delivery date using typical durations for each milestone
   - Adjust for item-specific factors (customs in Chile: 2-3 weeks, not 1 week)
2. Populate milestone tracker with planned dates
3. Record actual dates for milestones already completed (PO issued, vendor acknowledged, etc.)
4. Identify items where early milestones are already late (immediate action required)

**Step 3: Establish Vendor Communication Protocol**
1. For each vendor, identify:
   - Project manager / account manager (primary contact)
   - Expediting contact (for progress reports)
   - Quality contact (for inspection coordination)
   - Shipping contact (for logistics coordination)
2. Define communication frequency based on item classification:
   - ULL: Weekly vendor calls, monthly factory visits
   - LL: Bi-weekly vendor calls, quarterly factory visits
   - ML: Monthly vendor calls
   - SLT: Monthly email status request
3. Set up automated reminder calendar for vendor follow-ups
4. Store vendor contact matrix in mcp-sharepoint

**Step 4: Integrate with Project Schedule**
1. Map every long-lead item to its downstream construction/commissioning activity:
   - Equipment: installation activity, commissioning sequence step
   - Spare parts: commissioning support requirement, operational readiness gate
2. Identify critical path items: items where delivery delay = commissioning delay (zero float)
3. Identify near-critical items: items with <30 days of float
4. Generate commissioning impact matrix: which systems are at risk if each item is delayed
5. Share critical path assessment with OR Orchestrator (H-01) and agent-project

### Phase 2: Active Monitoring (Steps 5-8)

**Step 5: Monitor Vendor Progress (Continuous)**
1. Receive and process vendor expediting reports:
   - Parse milestone update data (actual dates, revised forecasts)
   - Compare against planned milestone dates
   - Calculate variance for each milestone
   - Detect trends: is vendor consistently slipping (cumulative delay)?
2. Log vendor communication in expediting log:
   - Date of contact, method (email/call/visit), vendor representative
   - Key information: progress status, issues, revised dates, commitments
3. For factory visits:
   - Verify physical progress matches reported progress
   - Photograph key manufacturing stages (evidence file)
   - Verify material certifications and quality documentation progress
4. Update milestone tracker with latest data

**Step 6: Generate Alerts and Trigger Expediting**
1. Daily alert scan:
   - Compare current forecast delivery dates against required-on-site dates
   - Compare actual milestone dates against planned milestone dates
   - Calculate trending delay: if milestones are consistently 2 weeks late, assume delivery will be 2 weeks late
2. Generate alerts per escalation matrix:
   - Watch: Send to procurement lead via mcp-outlook
   - Alert: Send to procurement manager + project manager; initiate expediting
   - Critical: Send to project director + OR manager; request emergency meeting
   - Emergency: Send to VP Operations; invoke emergency procurement authority
3. For Alert and Critical items, initiate expediting workflow:
   - Contact vendor for formal recovery plan (due within 5 business days)
   - Assess vendor's recovery plan credibility (history, capacity, commitment)
   - Evaluate acceleration options (see Expediting Decision Framework)
   - Present options with cost/benefit analysis to decision-maker
4. Log all alerts and responses in Alert & Expediting Log

**Step 7: Track Logistics and Shipping**
1. When item ships ex-works:
   - Confirm shipping documentation (packing list, material certificates, invoice, origin certificate)
   - Record transport mode, carrier, and tracking information
   - Estimate arrival dates based on transport mode:
     - Sea freight (China to Chile): 35-45 days
     - Sea freight (Europe to Chile): 25-35 days
     - Air freight (global to Chile): 3-7 days
     - Overland (within South America): 5-15 days
   - Monitor vessel/aircraft tracking via carrier systems
2. Customs clearance tracking:
   - Verify import documentation completeness before arrival
   - Coordinate with customs broker for pre-clearance where possible
   - Track customs processing status (document review, inspection, duty payment, release)
   - Common delays: incomplete documentation (3-7 days), physical inspection (2-5 days), regulatory hold (variable)
3. Inland transport to site:
   - Coordinate heavy-haul for oversized equipment
   - Verify site access arrangements (road permits, escorts, crane availability)
   - Schedule delivery window with site logistics team
4. Update logistics tracker with all milestone dates

**Step 8: Monitor Quality and Inspection**
1. Track Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) scheduling and results:
   - FAT date confirmed with vendor and client inspector
   - FAT protocol agreed (what is tested, acceptance criteria)
   - FAT witnessed by client representative or third-party inspector
   - FAT results documented with photographs and data
2. Handle FAT failures:
   - Document non-conformance clearly
   - Assess impact on delivery schedule
   - Agree corrective actions and re-test schedule with vendor
   - Update forecast delivery date
3. Track site receipt inspection:
   - Receiving inspection protocol (visual, dimensional, functional as applicable)
   - Damage check (transport damage claim if needed)
   - Material certificate verification
   - Storage requirements confirmation (indoor, covered, open, climate-controlled)
4. Record inspection results in register; close procurement milestone on successful receipt

### Phase 3: Reporting & Continuous Improvement (Steps 9-14)

**Step 9: Generate Weekly Status Report**
1. Compile status across all tracked items
2. Highlight changes since last report:
   - New items added to tracking
   - Milestone completions
   - New alerts generated
   - Alerts resolved
   - Items received at site
3. Upcoming deliveries (next 30 days):
   - Items expected to arrive
   - Customs processing in progress
   - FATs scheduled
4. Actions required from management:
   - Expediting decisions (cost approval)
   - Alternative sourcing decisions
   - Schedule change notifications
5. Distribute via mcp-outlook to project team

**Step 10: Update Gate Review Packages**
1. At each gate review (G2, G3, G4, G5):
   - Generate procurement readiness summary
   - List items delivered and in-service
   - List items in-transit with expected arrival
   - List items at risk and mitigation plans
   - Calculate procurement readiness percentage: items received / total items required
2. Provide data to generate-or-gate-review (H-03) for inclusion in gate package

**Step 11: Manage Alternative Sourcing**
1. When primary vendor cannot meet schedule:
   - Search alternative vendor database for qualified suppliers
   - Evaluate alternatives on: lead time, cost, quality, warranty, compatibility
   - Technical validation: ensure alternative meets specification (coordinate with engineering)
   - Commercial evaluation: total cost including qualification, testing, and risk premium
2. Present options to procurement management with recommendation
3. If alternative approved: issue new PO, track both primary and alternative until decision point
4. Close alternative PO if primary vendor recovers, or cancel primary and shift to alternative

**Step 12: Perform Vendor Performance Analysis**
1. Track vendor performance metrics:
   - On-time delivery percentage
   - Average delay in days
   - Quality acceptance rate
   - Communication responsiveness
   - Recovery capability (when behind, can they recover?)
2. Generate vendor scorecard quarterly
3. Share vendor performance data with agent-procurement for vendor management
4. Recommend vendor qualification status changes:
   - Poor performers: add to watch list, reduce future award probability
   - Strong performers: preferred vendor status, consider long-term agreements

**Step 13: Reconcile Procurement Costs**
1. Track all procurement costs against budget:
   - PO values vs. budget allocation
   - Expediting costs (air freight premiums, overtime charges, alternative sourcing premiums)
   - Inspection and testing costs
   - Customs duties and taxes (actual vs. estimated)
   - Transport costs (actual vs. budget)
2. Calculate total cost variance and forecast at completion
3. Report to agent-finance for project cost update

**Step 14: Post-Delivery Lessons Learned**
1. For each item received:
   - Actual lead time vs. quoted lead time
   - Actual cost vs. PO value (including change orders)
   - Quality issues encountered
   - Logistics challenges
2. Update vendor lead time database with actual performance data
3. Feed lessons into generate-initial-spares-list (K-01) for lead time assumption updates
4. Feed lessons into optimize-mro-inventory (K-02) for reorder parameter calibration
5. Contribute to project lessons learned database

EXPEDITING ANALYSIS: SAG Mill Main Motor (5,000 kW)
============================================

Current Situation:
  Vendor: WEG Motors (Jaragu do Sul, Brazil)
  PO Value: $4.2M
  PO Date: 2025-08-15
  Promised Delivery: 2027-01-15 (ex-works)
  Revised Forecast: 2027-04-01 (ex-works) -- 75 day delay
  Required On-Site: 2027-03-01

  Root Cause: Global copper wire shortage affecting stator winding
  manufacturing. WEG's supplier delayed delivery of specialty enameled
  copper wire by 10 weeks. Manufacturing timeline compressed where possible
  but still net 75-day delay.

  Normal Logistics (Sea Freight):
    Ex-works to Santos port: 3 days
    Sea freight Santos to San Antonio, Chile: 20-25 days
    Customs clearance: 10-15 days
    Transport to site: 5 days
    TOTAL: 38-48 days
    Normal delivery to site: 2027-05-19 (75 days after required-on-site)

Options Analysis:
  Option A: Accept Delay
    - Motor arrives site: 2027-05-19 (75 days late)
    - Commissioning impact: SAG mill circuit delayed 75 days
    - Production impact: $45M/month x 2.5 months = $112M in deferred revenue
    - Cost: $0 additional procurement cost
    - Risk: Other systems idle while waiting for mill

  Option B: Air Freight (Recommended)
    - Ex-works: 2027-04-01
    - Air freight Santos to Santiago (AN-124 Antonov charter): 2 days
    - Customs (pre-cleared): 5 days
    - Oversize transport to site: 7 days
    - Arrival at site: 2027-04-15 (45 days late, but within 38-day float)
    - Commissioning impact: 7-day delay (within recovery range)
    - Production impact: ~$10M in compressed ramp-up
    - Cost: $180K air freight + $45K special transport = $225K
    - Risk: Low (AN-124 availability confirmed)
    - ROI: ($112M avoided delay - $225K expediting) / $225K = 497:1

  Option C: Alternative Vendor (ABB, Switzerland)
    - ABB can deliver identical spec motor in 32 weeks from order
    - If ordered today: delivery 2027-01-30 (sea freight to Chile)
    - Arrives site: 2027-03-15 (14 days late, within float)
    - Cost: $4.8M (14% premium over WEG price)
    - Premium cost: $600K
    - Risk: Medium (new motor requires re-validation of foundation design)
    - Additional cost: $80K for foundation re-check
    - Total cost: $680K but eliminates all delay risk

  Option D: Vendor Recovery (WEG Acceleration)
    - WEG can add 2nd shift on motor assembly: reduces delay by 15 days
    - Vendor absorbs cost (contractual obligation for partial recovery)
    - Revised delivery: 2027-03-15 ex-works
    - Combined with air freight: arrive site 2027-03-29 (28 days late, within float)
    - Cost: $225K air freight only (vendor absorbs acceleration cost)

RECOMMENDATION: Option D (Vendor Recovery + Air Freight)
  - Delivery to site: 2027-03-29 (within schedule float)
  - Cost: $225K (lowest option that eliminates schedule risk)
  - Vendor contractually obligated for partial recovery
  - Air freight provides additional schedule protection
  - Decision required by: 2026-06-30 (to confirm AN-124 booking)
