# Manage Vendor Documentation
## Skill ID: DOC-01
## Version: 1.0.0
## Category: B. Document Management
## Priority: P1 - Critical
## Agent: Agent 2 - Documentation & Knowledge Management

## Purpose

Manage the complete vendor document lifecycle for megaprojects handling 500,000 to 2,000,000+ documents across all engineering, procurement, construction, and commissioning phases. This skill provides end-to-end governance of vendor documentation from initial submittal requirements through final handover to operations, ensuring every document is received, reviewed, approved, registered, and stored in the correct revision with full traceability.

Vendor documentation is the single largest volume of deliverables in capital projects, yet industry data consistently shows that 20-40% of required vendor documents are incomplete or missing at mechanical completion and handover (CII Research Report 2019, Independent Project Analysis benchmarks). This gap creates cascading failures: maintenance cannot develop procedures without vendor manuals, commissioning teams lack test certificates, and operations staff cannot be trained on equipment they have no documentation for. The average cost of poor vendor documentation is estimated at 2-5% of total installed cost (TIC) in rework, delays, and operational inefficiency during the first 2 years of operation.

This skill directly addresses Pain Point OG-03 (Operational Gap - Documentation Completeness) by establishing automated tracking, intelligent follow-up workflows, and predictive analytics to identify documentation gaps before they become critical path items.

## Intent & Specification

The AI agent MUST understand and execute the following core objectives:

1. **Vendor Document Requirement Register (VDRR) Management**: Maintain a comprehensive register of all required vendor documents mapped to purchase orders, equipment tags, and project milestones. The VDRR is the master index -- every document that will be received, reviewed, and handed over must be tracked here. Typical megaproject VDRRs contain 15,000-50,000 line items across 200-500 purchase orders.

2. **Submittal Tracking & Follow-Up Automation**: Track document submittals against contractual deadlines, automatically generate follow-up notifications at 7-day, 14-day, and 30-day overdue thresholds, and escalate to procurement managers when vendors fail to submit. Industry data shows that 35-50% of vendor documents require at least one follow-up before initial submission.

3. **Review Cycle Management**: Manage the technical review cycle including distribution to reviewers, tracking review status, consolidating comments, and returning documents to vendors with review codes (A1-Approved, B2-Approved with Comments, C3-Revise and Resubmit, D4-Rejected). Average review cycle time should be <14 calendar days; this skill tracks and reports on review cycle time compliance.

4. **Revision Control & Supersession**: Maintain strict revision control ensuring that only the latest approved revision is accessible as the "current" version while all previous revisions are archived with full audit trail. The agent must prevent common errors such as distributing superseded revisions or losing track of which revision was approved.

5. **Handover Package Assembly**: Assemble final documentation handover packages (often called "data books" or "vendor data packages") organized by system, equipment, or discipline. Each package must include all required documents at the correct approved revision. Handover readiness is measured as a percentage of required documents received, reviewed, and approved at the correct revision.

6. **Quality & Completeness Analytics**: Provide real-time dashboards and periodic reports on documentation completeness, vendor performance (on-time submission rates), review cycle efficiency, and handover readiness. Flag risks early -- if a vendor's document submission rate is declining, the agent must alert before it becomes critical.

7. **Multi-Format Ingestion**: Handle documents in all common industrial formats including PDF, DWG, DXF, STEP, IGES, native CAD formats, Excel, Word, and specialized formats such as instrument data sheets, P&IDs, and 3D model files. The agent must validate file integrity and format compliance upon receipt.

- Documentation deficiencies account for 15-25% of commissioning delays
- Cost of retrieving a single misfiled document: $120 average; cost of recreating a lost document: $220 average (AIIM International)

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: VDRR Setup & Configuration (Steps 1-3)

**Step 1: Initialize Vendor Document Requirement Register**
- Parse the Purchase Order Register to extract all POs with equipment scope
- For each PO, determine required document types based on equipment category:
  - Rotating equipment (pumps, compressors): GA drawings, sectional drawings, O&M manuals, performance curves, material certificates, test reports, spare parts lists, data sheets
  - Static equipment (vessels, heat exchangers): GA drawings, fabrication drawings, calculations, material certificates, NDE reports, PWHT records, data sheets, nameplate data
  - Electrical equipment: SLDs, wiring diagrams, O&M manuals, test reports, setting schedules
  - Instrumentation: Loop diagrams, data sheets, calibration certificates, configuration files
  - Piping/valves: Material certificates, test reports, valve data sheets
- Generate VDRR line items with unique IDs, contractual due dates derived from PO delivery dates minus lead time for review
- Validate document numbering against project convention
- Upload VDRR to SharePoint (via mcp-sharepoint) as controlled document

**Step 2: Configure Review Matrix**
- Map each document type to required reviewer disciplines
- Assign primary reviewer and secondary/parallel reviewers
- Set review deadline calculation rules (typically 10-14 calendar days from receipt)
- Configure escalation thresholds and notification recipients
- Establish review code authority levels (who can approve, reject, or issue codes)

**Step 3: Establish Vendor Portals & Submission Channels**
- Configure document submission channels per vendor (email, SharePoint upload, vendor portal)
- Set up automated ingestion rules:
  - Email attachments from registered vendor email addresses are auto-captured
  - SharePoint upload triggers workflow notification
  - File naming convention validation on upload
- Send vendor notification with submission instructions, document numbering requirements, and format specifications
- Register vendor document controller contact information for follow-up automation

### Phase 2: Ongoing Document Management (Steps 4-7)

**Step 4: Document Receipt & Registration**
- For each document received:
  - Validate file integrity (not corrupted, readable, correct format)
  - Validate document number against VDRR (must match an expected document)
  - Check revision: if revision already registered, flag as duplicate or supersession
  - Extract metadata: document title, revision, date, page count, file size
  - For PDFs: verify searchability (OCR check); flag non-searchable PDFs
  - Register in VDRR with receipt date, revision, file location
  - Store document in designated SharePoint library with correct metadata tags
  - Update VDRR status from "Outstanding" to "Received - Pending Review"
  - Notify assigned reviewers that document is ready for review

**Step 5: Review Cycle Management**
- Distribute document to reviewers per Review Matrix
- Set review deadline and send calendar reminder
- Track reviewer progress:
  - Monitor review completion status per reviewer
  - Send reminder at 50% of review period elapsed if no response
  - Send escalation at 80% of review period if not complete
- Consolidate review comments from all reviewers:
  - Merge comment sheets/markups into single consolidated response
  - Resolve conflicting comments between disciplines
  - Assign review code based on most restrictive reviewer recommendation
- Return reviewed document to vendor with consolidated comments and review code
- Update VDRR with review code, review completion date, and review cycle duration
- If C3/D4: track vendor resubmission and repeat review cycle

**Step 6: Overdue Document Follow-Up**
- Daily scan of VDRR for overdue documents (past contractual due date, not received)
- Generate follow-up communications per escalation ladder:
  - **7-day overdue**: Automated email to vendor document controller
    - Subject: "OVERDUE REMINDER: Document {DocNumber} - {DocTitle} - PO {PONumber}"
    - Content: Contractual due date, days overdue, request for submission date commitment
  - **14-day overdue**: Escalated email to vendor project manager + internal procurement lead
    - Include list of all overdue documents for this vendor
    - Request meeting to discuss documentation recovery plan
  - **30-day overdue**: Formal notice to vendor commercial manager
    - Reference contractual obligations and potential consequences
    - Copy internal project manager and contracts team
    - Request formal vendor recovery schedule
  - **60-day overdue**: Contractual notification
    - Formal letter referencing liquidated damages or withholding clauses
    - Copy legal/contracts team
- Log all follow-up communications in Follow-Up Log sheet
- Track vendor responses and committed resubmission dates

**Step 7: Revision Control & Supersession**
- When a new revision is received for an existing document:
  - Archive the previous revision (move to "Superseded" folder, mark as superseded)
  - Register new revision as current in VDRR
  - Update all cross-references and hyperlinks
  - Notify holders of previous revision that it has been superseded
  - If the document was already approved at previous revision, trigger re-review of new revision
- Maintain complete revision history:
  - All revisions retained in archive
  - Revision comparison log (what changed between revisions)
  - Full audit trail of who accessed/downloaded each revision

### Phase 3: Handover Preparation (Steps 8-10)

**Step 8: Handover Readiness Assessment**
- For each system/area approaching handover:
  - Query VDRR for all documents associated with equipment in that system
  - Calculate handover readiness percentage:
    - GREEN: >95% documents received and approved at correct revision
    - AMBER: 80-95% complete
    - RED: <80% complete
  - Identify gap list: all documents still outstanding, under review, or at wrong revision
  - Assess impact of gaps: which gaps are critical for operations/maintenance vs. nice-to-have
  - Generate gap closure plan with realistic dates based on vendor performance history

**Step 9: Data Book Assembly**
- Assemble final vendor data packages per system/equipment:
  - Organize documents per handover specification (typically by system, then equipment, then document type)
  - Verify all documents are at final approved revision
  - Generate table of contents and index
  - Create bookmarked PDF compilation where required
  - Include transmittal cover sheet with document listing and approval signatures
- Validate data book completeness:
  - Cross-check against VDRR: every "required" document must be present
  - Verify file readability and print quality
  - Confirm correct revision for each document
  - Flag any documents included with caveats (e.g., "Approved with Comments" but vendor did not resubmit)

**Step 10: Final Handover Execution**
- Generate handover transmittal for owner/operator acceptance
- Upload final data packages to owner's document management system
- Generate handover completion certificate listing:
  - Total documents handed over
  - Documents pending (with expected dates)
  - Known gaps with risk assessment
  - Outstanding vendor obligations
- Close out VDRR with final status for all line items
- Archive project documentation records per retention policy
- Generate lessons learned report:
  - Vendor performance summary
  - Document types most frequently delayed
  - Review cycle bottlenecks
  - Recommendations for future projects

## Quality Criteria

### Quantitative Thresholds

| Criterion | Target | Minimum Acceptable |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| VDRR line item coverage (all POs registered) | 100% | >98% |
| Document receipt tracking accuracy | 100% | >99% |
| Review cycle time (median) | <10 days | <14 days |
| Review cycle time compliance (% within deadline) | >90% | >80% |
| Follow-up automation coverage | 100% | >95% |
| Handover completeness at MC | >95% | >90% |
| Document metadata accuracy | >99% | >97% |
| Revision control accuracy (correct current rev) | 100% | >99.5% |
| Vendor scorecard update frequency | Weekly | Bi-weekly |
| Overdue document response rate (vendor responds within 7 days of follow-up) | >80% | >60% |

### Qualitative Standards

- **Traceability**: Every document must be traceable from PO requirement through receipt, review, approval, and handover. Complete audit trail must be available.
- **Single Source of Truth**: The VDRR is the authoritative register. No parallel tracking spreadsheets should exist. All stakeholders reference the same data.
- **Proactive Risk Management**: The system must predict documentation gaps before they impact downstream activities (commissioning, training, maintenance planning).
- **Vendor Accountability**: Vendor performance data must be objective, factual, and contractually defensible. Avoid subjective assessments.
- **Handover Quality**: Operations and maintenance teams must be able to find any vendor document within 3 minutes of searching the handover package.

### Validation Process
1. Monthly VDRR completeness audit: verify all POs are registered, all expected documents have line items
2. Weekly status report accuracy check: reconcile reported numbers with actual document counts
3. Quarterly vendor scorecard review with procurement team
4. Pre-handover gap analysis at system level (minimum 90 days before planned handover)
5. Post-handover validation: verify owner/operator can access and retrieve all handed-over documents
