## Purpose

Model the optimal commissioning sequence from construction completion through pre-commissioning, commissioning, and operational acceptance for capital projects, ensuring that System Turnover Packages (STPs), Inspection Test Plan Sheets (ITPS), and commissioning dependencies are correctly sequenced to minimize schedule risk and prevent startup failures. This skill produces a logic-driven commissioning sequence model that maps every system from mechanical completion (MC) through to sustained commercial operation, identifying the critical path, resource constraints, and inter-system dependencies that determine whether a project starts up on time or suffers costly delays.

Commissioning is the most compressed phase in megaprojects, typically representing only 10-15% of total project duration but where 60-80% of all startup problems manifest (IPA Benchmarking data, 2022; CII Research Report 212-11). The consequences of poor commissioning sequencing are severe and well-documented: the average megaproject experiences 6-12 months of schedule overrun during the commissioning-to-operations transition phase, with each month of delay costing $5-50 million depending on project scale (IPA "Commissioning and Startup Best Practices," 2019). The Construction Industry Institute reports that projects in the top quartile of commissioning planning performance achieve first production 4-6 months earlier than those in the bottom quartile, representing hundreds of millions of dollars in accelerated revenue.

This skill directly addresses **Pain Point MP-03** (Megaproject Commissioning Delay): 60% of commissioning delays stem from incorrect sequencing of turnover packages, utility availability gaps, and uncoordinated vendor support windows. The root causes are systemic: commissioning sequences are typically developed late in the project lifecycle, often by construction schedulers who lack operational commissioning experience. System Turnover Packages are defined without adequate input from operations teams, leading to system boundaries that make construction sense but commissioning nonsense. Inspection Test Plan Sheets are tracked independently from commissioning activities, creating disconnected workflows where ITPS completion gates are not aligned with the commissioning logic network. Vendor commissioning support windows are booked based on construction progress forecasts rather than actual commissioning sequence requirements, resulting in vendors arriving before prerequisites are met or departing before their systems are fully commissioned.

The financial and operational impact extends beyond schedule delay. Incorrect sequencing leads to multiple start-stop-restart cycles for commissioning crews (estimated 20-30% efficiency loss per remobilization), utility systems being stressed by partial-load operations they were not designed for, and safety incidents caused by attempting to commission systems whose prerequisites have not been verified. OSHA PSM enforcement data shows that 25-30% of pre-startup safety review (PSSR) failures are attributable to commissioning sequence errors -- systems presented for PSSR that have upstream dependencies still incomplete. This skill eliminates these failure modes by producing a mathematically validated, logic-networked, resource-loaded commissioning sequence model that serves as the single source of truth for the entire commissioning and startup campaign.

### Functional Intent

This skill SHALL:

1. **Define System Boundaries for Commissioning**: Establish commissioning system boundaries that follow process logic (not construction area logic), ensuring each System Turnover Package represents a complete, testable functional unit with defined battery limits, isolation points, and handover criteria.

2. **Create System Turnover Packages (STPs)**: Generate structured STPs for each commissioning system containing mechanical completion checklists, pre-commissioning requirements, commissioning test procedures, punch list management protocols, and acceptance criteria for each stage (MC, Pre-Comm, Comm, TCCC).

3. **Map Prerequisite Dependencies**: Build a complete prerequisite dependency network that captures all inter-system dependencies including utility availability requirements, process feed dependencies, control system integration requirements, safety system prerequisites, and regulatory approval gates.

4. **Develop Logic Network**: Create a CPM (Critical Path Method) logic network linking all commissioning activities with finish-to-start, start-to-start, and finish-to-finish relationships, producing a mathematically valid schedule that identifies the critical path and near-critical paths.

5. **Align ITPS with Commissioning Activities**: Map every Inspection Test Plan Sheet to its corresponding commissioning activity, ensuring that ITPS hold points are scheduled, witness notifications are timed correctly, and ITPS completion gates align with the commissioning logic network.

6. **Schedule Vendor Support Windows**: Coordinate vendor commissioning support requirements with the commissioning sequence, ensuring vendors arrive after prerequisites are met, have adequate duration for their scope, and that handover from vendor to owner commissioning team is structured.

7. **Perform Critical Path Analysis and Optimization**: Identify the critical path, calculate total float for all activities, identify resource-driven critical paths (where resource constraints extend duration beyond logic-driven duration), and optimize the sequence to minimize total commissioning duration.

8. **Establish Monitoring Framework**: Create the progress monitoring framework with earned value metrics, milestone tracking, look-ahead scheduling, and early warning triggers for commissioning sequence deviations.

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: System Boundary Definition and STP Creation (Steps 1-4)

**Step 1: Define Commissioning System Boundaries**
- Review process flow diagrams and P&IDs to identify functional commissioning systems
- Apply NORSOK Z-007 system boundary principles: each system must be a complete, isolatable, testable functional unit
- Define battery limits for each system: isolation valves, electrical breakers, instrument boundaries
- Verify system boundaries enable independent testing (a system should be pre-commissionable and commissionable without depending on all adjacent systems being complete)
- Assign equipment from the equipment list to commissioning systems
- Create system hierarchy: System > Subsystem > Equipment Tag
- Generate system boundary drawings (single-line representation of each system scope)
- Validate boundaries with operations team (systems must make operational sense, not just construction sense)

**Step 2: Create System Turnover Packages (STPs)**
- For each defined system, generate the STP containing:
  - System scope definition (equipment list, P&ID references, battery limits)
  - Mechanical completion checklist by discipline (piping, mechanical, electrical, instrument, civil)
  - Pre-commissioning activity checklist by discipline
  - Commissioning activity checklist (functional testing, integrated testing)
  - ITPS requirements (hold points, witness points, review points)
  - Punch list management protocol (A/B/C classification criteria)
  - Stage gate acceptance criteria (MC complete, Pre-Comm complete, Comm complete, TCCC ready)
  - Sign-off sheets for each handover gate
- Number STPs sequentially aligned with system codes
- Store STPs in mcp-sharepoint (commissioning document library)

**Step 3: Map Prerequisite Dependencies**
- For each commissioning system, identify all prerequisites:
  - **Utility prerequisites**: Which utilities must be available? (power at what voltage, compressed air at what pressure, water at what flow rate)
  - **Process prerequisites**: Which upstream systems must be commissioned first? (e.g., grinding cannot commission without crushing providing feed)
  - **Control system prerequisites**: Which DCS/PLC modules must be commissioned? What network connectivity is required?
  - **Safety prerequisites**: Which safety systems must be verified? (fire protection, gas detection, emergency shutdown)
  - **Regulatory prerequisites**: Which permits, inspections, or approvals are required before proceeding?
  - **Documentation prerequisites**: Which procedures, training completions, and certifications must be in place?
- Build a prerequisite dependency matrix (System x System) showing all inter-system dependencies
- Classify each dependency by type and criticality (Hard = cannot proceed without; Soft = preferred but workaround exists)
- Identify circular dependencies and resolve (no system can depend on itself directly or transitively)

**Step 4: Develop ITPS Alignment**
- Map every ITPS in the ITPS register to its corresponding commissioning system and activity
- Verify that ITPS hold points are embedded in the commissioning logic network as activity constraints
- Calculate notification lead times for witness points (typically 5-10 business days for client, 15-20 days for regulatory)
- Identify ITPS bottlenecks: hold points requiring third-party or regulatory witness that could delay commissioning if not scheduled
- Create ITPS scheduling protocol: when to notify, who to notify, what to do if witness is unavailable
- Align ITPS completion requirements with STP stage gates (all applicable ITPS must be complete before stage gate sign-off)

### Phase 2: Logic Network Development and Resource Loading (Steps 5-8)

**Step 5: Build Logic Network**
- Create the commissioning logic network using CPM (Critical Path Method) methodology:
  - Define all commissioning activities from STP checklists (typically 500-5,000 activities depending on project scale)
  - Assign durations to each activity based on industry benchmarks and project-specific factors:
    - Piping pressure test: 1-5 days per system depending on complexity
    - Electrical energization: 2-7 days per MCC/switchgear
    - Loop checking: 30 min/analog loop, 15 min/digital loop, 60 min/SIL loop
    - Equipment functional test: 1-3 days per major equipment item
    - System integration test: 3-10 days per system
    - Performance test: 3-14 days depending on process complexity
  - Link activities with predecessor/successor relationships:
    - Finish-to-Start (FS): Most common; activity B cannot start until A finishes
    - Start-to-Start (SS): Activities can start simultaneously (e.g., parallel discipline pre-commissioning)
    - Finish-to-Finish (FF): Activities must finish together (e.g., all pre-comm disciplines must finish before commissioning starts)
    - Lag/Lead times as appropriate (e.g., concrete cure time, coating dry time)
  - Embed utility availability dates as external constraints
  - Embed regulatory approval gates as milestone constraints
  - Embed vendor support windows as resource constraints

**Step 6: Perform Resource Loading**
- Assign commissioning resources to each activity:
  - Commissioning team personnel by discipline (mechanical, electrical, instrument, process)
  - Vendor technical support (OEM representatives)
  - Operations support (operators required for commissioning support)
  - Third-party inspection resources
  - Test equipment and temporary facilities
- Calculate resource requirements by week/month for each discipline
- Identify resource conflicts (where demand exceeds supply)
- Perform resource leveling: adjust non-critical activity timing to smooth resource peaks while maintaining the critical path
- Identify resource-driven critical path (where resource constraints extend the schedule beyond logic-driven duration)
- Prepare resource mobilization/demobilization schedule

**Step 7: Perform Critical Path Analysis**
- Calculate forward pass (earliest start/finish dates) and backward pass (latest start/finish dates) for all activities
- Identify critical path (longest path through the network, zero total float)
- Identify near-critical paths (total float < 5 days)
- Analyze critical path composition:
  - What percentage is utility commissioning? (typically 15-25%)
  - What percentage is major equipment commissioning? (typically 30-40%)
  - What percentage is system integration and performance testing? (typically 25-35%)
  - What percentage is administrative/regulatory gates? (typically 5-15%)
- Identify schedule acceleration opportunities:
  - Activities that can be paralleled (currently sequential but could be simultaneous with additional resources)
  - Activities with conservative duration estimates that can be compressed
  - Administrative gates that can be started earlier
  - Vendor support that can be extended or overlapped

**Step 8: Schedule Vendor Support Windows**
- For each vendor-supported commissioning activity:
  - Identify the earliest possible start date (all prerequisites met)
  - Identify the latest acceptable start date (maintaining total float)
  - Define the optimal vendor arrival window (2-3 days before activity start for mobilization)
  - Define minimum vendor presence duration (activity duration + contingency)
  - Identify handover requirements (what the vendor must leave behind: reports, certificates, training)
- Coordinate vendor windows with:
  - Vendor availability (some vendors support multiple projects globally)
  - Travel and visa requirements (for international vendors)
  - Construction completion forecasts (vendor arrives after prerequisites are confirmed complete)
- Create vendor support matrix showing all vendor windows on a timeline

### Phase 3: Optimization and Risk Assessment (Steps 9-12)

**Step 9: Map Utility Availability**
- For each utility system, define:
  - Design capacity and commissioning capacity (often different -- partial load during commissioning)
  - Staged availability dates (e.g., temporary power before permanent power)
  - Commissioning load profile (what utilities each commissioning activity requires)
  - Backup provisions (generator backup, temporary air compressor, water trucking)
- Verify utility availability aligns with commissioning sequence:
  - No commissioning activity is scheduled before its utility prerequisite is available
  - Utility capacity is sufficient for concurrent commissioning activities
  - Utility system commissioning is sequenced first in the overall commissioning logic
- Flag utility gaps: periods where demand exceeds available capacity, requiring either schedule adjustment or temporary provisions

**Step 10: Perform Risk Assessment**
- Conduct commissioning sequence risk assessment:
  - **Schedule risks**: MC date slippage, vendor availability changes, regulatory approval delays
  - **Technical risks**: Equipment performance failures during testing, integration issues between systems
  - **Resource risks**: Key personnel unavailability, skill shortages, crew fatigue
  - **External risks**: Weather impacts, supply chain disruptions, utility provider issues
  - **Safety risks**: Concurrent construction and commissioning (SIMOPS), first-time energization, process fluid introduction
- For each risk, assess probability (1-5), consequence (1-5), and calculate risk score
- Assign mitigation measures for all risks scored > 12 (High) and > 16 (Critical)
- Embed risk mitigations in the commissioning sequence model (float buffers, contingency activities, hold points)
- Create commissioning risk register as appendix to the Commissioning Procedure Register

**Step 11: Optimize Schedule**
- Apply schedule optimization techniques:
  - **Critical chain method**: Add project buffer at the end, remove individual activity contingency
  - **Fast-tracking**: Overlap sequential activities where possible (with managed risk)
  - **Crashing**: Add resources to critical path activities to reduce duration (with cost-benefit analysis)
  - **Resource smoothing**: Adjust non-critical activities to reduce resource peaks and valleys
  - **What-if analysis**: Model scenarios for MC date slippage, vendor delays, and weather impacts
- Validate optimized schedule against project milestones:
  - First utility available date
  - First equipment energization date
  - First process fluid introduction date
  - First product date
  - Performance guarantee test start date
  - Commercial operation date
- Iterate until the commissioning sequence model achieves all milestones within acceptable float

**Step 12: Establish Monitoring Framework**
- Define commissioning progress monitoring system:
  - **Earned value metrics**: BCWP, BCWS, ACWP for commissioning activities
  - **Physical progress**: % complete by system, by phase, by discipline
  - **Milestone tracking**: Planned vs. actual milestone dates with trend analysis
  - **Look-ahead scheduling**: 2-week and 4-week rolling look-ahead with daily updates
  - **Early warning triggers**: Float erosion alerts, resource overload alerts, prerequisite delay alerts
- Configure monitoring dashboard in mcp-project-online / mcp-airtable:
  - S-curve: planned vs. actual commissioning progress
  - Gantt chart: top-level system commissioning timeline with RAG coding
  - Prerequisite status: traffic light view of all prerequisites by system
  - Critical path status: current critical path with identified risks
  - Vendor support tracker: upcoming vendor windows with readiness status
- Define reporting cadence:
  - Daily: commissioning flash report (activities completed, issues, look-ahead)
  - Weekly: detailed commissioning progress report with earned value analysis
  - Monthly: commissioning management report with trend analysis and risk update
- Store all reports and tracking data in mcp-sharepoint (commissioning library)
