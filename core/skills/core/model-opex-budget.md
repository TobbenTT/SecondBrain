### Staffing Cost Methodology

#### Burden Rate Calculation (Chile/Latin America typical)

| Component | Typical Range | Description |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| Base Salary | 100% | Gross monthly salary x 12 + bonuses |
| Social Charges | 20-30% | Pension, health, unemployment insurance |
| Gratification Legal | 4.75 months cap | Chilean legal benefit (25% of salary, capped) |
| Vacation Provision | 6-8% | Accrued vacation cost |
| Severance Provision | 5-8% | Indemnity provision (1 month/year) |
| Benefits (other) | 5-15% | Meal allowance, transport, housing, etc. |
| Training | 2-5% | Annual training investment per person |
| PPE & Uniforms | 1-3% | Safety gear, uniforms, tools |
| **Total Burden Multiplier** | **1.40 - 1.70** | **Applied to base annual salary** |

#### Shift Pattern Cost Impact

| Pattern | Crew Factor | Premium Impact |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Day shift (5x2) | 1.0 | None |
| 2-shift (morning + afternoon) | 2.0 | +5-10% |
| 3-shift (24h, 5 days) | 3.3 | +15-20% |
| 4x3 continuous (24/7) | 4.0-4.3 | +25-35% |
| 7x7 or 14x14 roster | 2.0-2.2 | +15-25% (+ travel/camp) |

### Maintenance Cost Estimation Methods

1. **Bottom-up (preferred):** Build from equipment list x maintenance tasks x frequencies x unit costs.
2. **Parametric:** Apply industry-standard percentages of Replacement Asset Value (RAV).
3. **Historical:** Use historical actuals adjusted for scope and inflation.
4. **Benchmarked:** Apply industry benchmark unit costs (e.g., USD/ton, USD/operating hour).

### Maintenance Cost Benchmarks (% of RAV)

| Industry | Q1 (Best) | Median | Q3 (Worst) |
|----------|-----------|--------|------------|
| Mining | 2.0-3.0% | 3.5-4.5% | 5.0-7.0% |
| Oil & Gas | 1.5-2.5% | 3.0-4.0% | 4.5-6.0% |
| Power Generation | 1.5-2.5% | 2.5-3.5% | 4.0-5.0% |
| Water Treatment | 2.0-3.0% | 3.0-4.0% | 4.5-6.0% |
| Manufacturing | 1.5-2.5% | 2.5-3.5% | 4.0-5.5% |

### Escalation Methodology

```
Cost_year_n = Cost_base * (1 + escalation_rate)^n

Differential escalation by category:
- Labor: CPI + 1-2% (wage inflation typically exceeds general inflation)
- Energy: Energy-specific inflation index (historically more volatile)
- Materials/Spare parts: PPI (Producer Price Index) or commodity-linked
- Contracts: CPI or contract-specific escalation clauses
- Insurance: Insurance market cycle adjusted
```

## Step-by-Step Execution

### Phase 1: Structure & Input (Steps 1-3)

**Step 1: Define budget scope and structure.**
- Confirm operational scope (what activities/assets are included).
- Establish the cost breakdown structure (CBS).
- Confirm currency, budget period, and reporting format.
- Identify fixed vs. variable cost elements.

**Step 2: Build staffing model.**
- Structure organizational chart by department/function.
- Assign headcount, salary grades, and shift patterns.
- Calculate fully loaded labor cost per role (burden rate applied).
- Apply shift premiums and overtime estimates.
- Sum to total staffing cost by department.

**Step 3: Build maintenance cost model.**
- If bottom-up: list maintenance tasks x frequencies x unit costs per equipment.
- If parametric: apply % of RAV by maintenance type.
- Separate PM, CM, predictive, and overhaul costs.
- Include spare parts inventory carrying costs.
- Include workshop, tools, and equipment costs.

### Phase 2: Cost Modeling (Steps 4-6)

**Step 4: Model contract and service costs.**
- List all third-party contracts with scope, duration, and annual cost.
- Separate fixed-fee from variable/unit-rate contracts.
- Include OEM support agreements.
- Add consulting and technical support allowances.

**Step 5: Model consumables and energy.**
- Calculate consumable consumption from operating parameters (e.g., reagent consumption per ton processed).
- Model energy cost from power demand, consumption profile, and tariff structure.
- Include fuel costs for mobile equipment and generators.
- Model water consumption and costs.

**Step 6: Model administrative and overhead costs.**
- Estimate insurance premiums based on asset value and risk profile.
- Include IT, communications, and cybersecurity costs.
- Add office supplies, facilities maintenance, and general overhead.
- Include regulatory compliance costs (permits, audits, monitoring).
- Apply contingency (typically 5-10% of total OPEX).

### Phase 3: Consolidation & Output (Steps 7-9)

**Step 7: Consolidate and reconcile.**
- Sum all cost categories to total OPEX.
- Calculate unit cost (OPEX per unit of production).
- Compare total against benchmarks for reasonableness.
- Identify fixed vs. variable cost split.
- Create monthly phasing based on seasonal patterns and overhaul schedules.

**Step 8: Multi-year projection.**
- Apply escalation rates to project 3-5 year OPEX trajectory.
- Include ramp-up effects for new operations (Year 1 may differ from steady state).
- Model step changes (e.g., major overhaul years, contract renewals).
- Present NPV of multi-year OPEX stream.

**Step 9: Sensitivity analysis and output.**
- Test sensitivity to top 5 cost drivers (+/-10-20%).
- Identify break-even production volume (where unit cost meets target).
- Build complete workbook with all sheets.
- Generate executive summary with key metrics and insights.
